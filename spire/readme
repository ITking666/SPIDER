Installing Spire

Spire requires Python, Tcl/Tk and several other Python libraries (Image,
Gnuplot, numpy, Pmw). The full installation of Spire includes its own version
of Python and the other packages.

The Spire installation assumes that you already have SPIDER installed on your
system.

The full installation installs all the packages required by Spire (about 100
Mb).

Copy/move the file spire_linux-1.5.5.tar to where you want Spire to be located.

Extract the file spire directory:
   tar xvf spire_linux-1.5.5.tar

Go to the spire_linux-1.5.5 directory, run the shell script ./install.sh:
   cd  spire_linux-1.5.5
   ./install.sh 

The install script sets up the environment and runs Spire's setup.py using the
Python under the spire directory.  

Various other executables are located in spire_linux-1.5.5/bin. The *.py files
(spire.py, ctfmatch.py, qview.py, etc.) are python programs which are moved to
the scripts directory; the corresponding files without the .py extension
(spire, ctfmatch, qview, etc.) are shell scripts that call the python programs
with the new python installed in the spire_linux-1.5.5/bin directory, thus
making sure the environment is set up properly. If you are using csh, add this
spire bin directory to your path by adding the following line to your .cshrc
file (substituting the correct full path):

   setenv PATH /full/path/to/spire_linux-1.5.5/bin:$PATH

or .bashrc for bash users:

   PATH=/full/path/to/spire_linux-1.5.5/bin:$PATH
   export PATH
