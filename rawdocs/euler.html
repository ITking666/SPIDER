<h1 align="center">Euler angles in SPIDER &amp; Web</h1>

<p>The Euler angles in SPIDER &amp; Web are defined as three
  successive rotations in a right hand coordinate system. </p>

<ol>
  <li> First, the object is rotated CLOCKWISE around the Z-axis 
      (angle 'phi')</li>
  <li> Then it is rotated CLOCKWISE around the original
       Y-axis (angle 'theta')</li>
  <li> Finally, it is rotated CLOCKWISE around the original
       Z-axis (angle 'psi').</li>
</ol>

<p> All rotations are done around axes of the original SPACE coordinate
 system and direction of rotation is determined by looking to the origin.</p>

<p>Note: If a volume is displayed in Web as slices, the observed rotations 
  will be, COUNTERCLOCKWISE for 'phi' and 'psi' rotations around Z-axis and
  CLOCKWISE for 'theta' rotation around Y-axis.  Web displays a volume
  with first slice on top.</p>

<pre>
 
The rotation matrices used are defined as:

v = Rv', where  R is the matrix for transforming vector v' to vector v. 

R        = R(psi) * R(theta) * R(phi) 

R(psi)   =   cos(psi)  sin(psi)  0
            -sin(psi)  cos(psi)  0
                0         0      1   
             
R(theta) =   cos(theta)  0 -sin(theta)
                0        1     0
             sin(theta)  0  cos(theta)
             
R(phi)   =   cos(phi)  sin(phi)  0 
            -sin(phi)  cos(phi)  0 
                0         0      1

<h3>Animation Notes:</h3>

<p>
  An object consisting of 3 cylinders of different lengths and
  diameters that coincide with the three orthogonal axes was 
  <a href= "../proc/b_euler.spi">created</a> using SPIDER.</p>

<p>The <a href="./man/rt3d.html">RT 3D</a> SPIDER operation was
  used to rotate this object by Phi: 40 Theta: 50 &amp; Psi: 70. A
  cylinder parallel to the rotation axis is embedded to the object
  before each rotation. Each rotation is done in 10 incremental steps
  to capture the position of the object for making the
  illustration. X', Y' and Z' are in the body coordinate system whereas Y
  and Z are in the space coordinate system.</p>
