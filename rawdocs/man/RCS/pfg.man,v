PF G      Profile an image row in a Gnuplot graph           PF G
                                                            12/13/14

PURPOSE:  Prepares a Gnuplot file containing 
          a profile along specified row(s) in an image.

SEE ALSO: GR   
          GR T  
          PF

USAGE:    PF G 

          .IMAGE FILE: PIC001
          [Enter the name of the image file.]

          .GNUPLOT OUTPUT FILE: CNT001
          [Enter name for Postscript output file.]

          .INDIVIDUAL, GLOBAL, or SUM SCALE PLOT? (I/G/S): G
          [Enter scaling option desired:                       '<br />'
           I--Individual.  Individually scaled with respect to
                           intensity range of the rows selected.'<br />'
         
           G--Global.      Scaled with respect to the intensity range
                           of the whole image file.  This option should be 
                           used if several rows of the same image are to 
                           be compared on same scale.'<br />'
           
           S--Sum.         Specified rows are summed into a single
                           profile, which is scaled between the minimum and
                           maximum values encountered in those rows.] '<br />'

          .ROW NUMBER(S): 1-12,15,18-22
          [Enter the row number(s) of interest.]
          [In the above example, profiles of rows 1-12, 15, and
          18-22 will be plotted.]

          .DISPLAY NOW? (Y/N): N
          [Displays plot on screen.   Only works if '<I>'"gnuplot"'</I>'
           is accessible on your system.
