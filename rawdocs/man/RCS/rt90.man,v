RT 90     RoTate - image or volume, by 90, 180, or 270 degrees    RT 90
                                                               05/17/10

PURPOSE:  To rotate an image 90, 180, or 270 about Z axis or rotate
          a 3-D volume 90, 180, or 270 degrees about either the
          X, Y, or Z axis.  This operation is '<b>'NOT '</b>'
          compatible with any other SPIDER "RT" operations since
          it does '<b>'NOT '</b>' use the standard SPIDER convention
          for the rotation center used in the other "RT" operations.
          Instead it does "rotation" by interchanging columns and
          rows / or slices. '<b>'This operation may alter handedness
          of a volume! '</b>' 

SEE ALSO: ROT      
          RT SF   
          RT SQ   

USAGE:    RT 90

          .INPUT FILE:  IMG000
           [Enter the name of the file to be rotated.]

          .OUTPUT FILE:  OUT000
           [Enter the name of the file where the rotated volume is to
           be kept.]
 
       Following three questions refer to original volume dimensions.

          .FIRST AND LAST X COLUMN NUMBER (OR <CR> FOR ALL): <CR>

          .FIRST AND LAST Y ROW NUMBER    (OR <CR> FOR ALL): 1, 50

          .FIRST AND LAST Z SLICE NUMBER  (OR <CR> FOR ALL): <CR>

          .ROTATION AXIS (X,Y,Z) (<CR> IS Z):  X
           [Uses a right-handed coordinate system.]

          .ROTATION ANGLE (90,180, OR 270):  90
          [All rotations are clockwise when looking along axis facing
          greater values.  X axis points to right, Y axis points 
          down screen, and Z axis is coming out of the screen.]

NOTES: 1. The time required will depend on the axis and angle.

       2. Any aspect ratio of image or volume is allowed (the
          volume does not have to be padded to a cube).

       3. This routine is crudely written, thus it is slow!

       3. The maximum size of image or volume which can be
          rotated depends upon the axis and angle.  The smallest 
          size limit is for rotations arond Y or Z axis by 90 or 
          270 degrees.  These rotations are limited to an output 
          slice of (MAXDIM - 16000) pixels.
