CP TO JPG   Copy SPIDER file to a JPEG format                CP TO JPG
                                                              04/07/13

PURPOSE:  Copies a SPIDER file to a JPEG format file. 
          Used '<a href='"'http://www.imagemagick.org'"'>'Imagemagick'</a>'
          which must be installed on your computer and available as: 'convert'.
          Assumes that SPIDER images are 'Most significant byte first' which
          is usually true and that the images may have negative intensities
          in them.

SEE ALSO: 
#include "cp_include.also"

USAGE:    CP TO JPG  

          .INPUT FILE: PIC001
          [Enter the name of the image to be copied. Does not
           work for volumes.]

          .JPG FILE: COP001
          [Enter the file that will contain the JPEG copy.]

NOTES:
       1. Creates a temporary file (JUNK_FOR_JPG.gray) which has intensities normalized
          from 0...1.0  since I am unable to get Imagemagick to 
          handle negative floats.

       2. Uses the following system invocation of Imagemagick:
          convert -verbose -depth 32 -size 192x192 -define quantum:format=floating-point -define quantum:scale=65536.0 -endian msb JUNK_FOR_JPG.gray your-filename.jpg

SUBROUTINE: COPYTOJPG

CALLER:     COPY1
