IQ SYNC   Wait until a file exists                           IQ SYNC 
                                                             8/08/08

PURPOSE:  To wait until a file exists.  A primitive method of
          synchronizing different SPIDER runs.

SEE ALSO: IQ GONE

USAGE:    IQ SYNC [waited] 

          .WAIT FOR EXISTENCE OF FILE: PIC001
          [Enter name of file which you want to wait for.  The file 
          may be a non-SPIDER file,
          a SPIDER image file, an image in a SPIDER image stack,
          an inline SPIDER "file", an image in an inline SPIDER
          image stack "file", or any other file.  If the file does not 
          exist, the system will query existence until it
          exists or till the maximum wait time has been exceeded.  

         .DELAY INTERVAL AND MAXIMUM WAIT(<0 --> NO ERROR): 1,360000
         [Specify the seconds for delay between queries and the 
         maximum overall wait time.  The default values are 1 second 
         delay between queries for a maximum wait of 9999999 seconds.
         If "MAXIMUM WAIT > 0" SPIDER will throw an error and will stop
         if not in interactive mode. If "MAXIMUM WAIT <0" SPIDER 
         return the waiting time in the optional command line 
         register and continue
         in both procedural and interactive mode.]

NOTES:   1. Optional operation line register receives the total wait time.
