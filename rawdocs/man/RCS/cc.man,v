CC        Cross Correlation ||                                    CC      
                                                            02/24/03

PURPOSE:  Computes the cross-correlation function of two
          images/volumes by using the Fourier transform relationship. 
          The dimensions of the two pictures must be the same.

SEE ALSO:  CC N   
           CN     
           CN N  
           AC    
           AC N   
           CC C   
           FT     

USAGE:    CC

          .INPUT FILE: PIC001
          [Enter the name of the first picture.   (Header
           positions from this file are transferred to output.)]

          .REFER FILE: REF001
          [Enter the name of the second picture, which is used
          as the reference.]

          .OUTPUT FILE: CCF001
          [Enter name of the file which will contain cross-correlation
          coefficients. It can be the same as the input file.  
          In this case
          INPUT FILE will be replaced by the cross correlation.]

NOTES: 1. The type of the input data can be real or Fourier in any 
          mixed form.

       2. The cross-correlation data are not scaled.  (If values are
          very, very large then maybe you should reduce the FMAX
          of the input files first?)

       3. The origin of the CCF is at (NX/2 + 1, NY/2 + 1, NZ/2 + 1).

       4. The CCF contains artifacts from wraparound overlaps
          implicit in the Fourier computation.
          However, the CCF is artifact-free within  '<br />'
           '&'nbsp; '&'nbsp;      -L <= K <= +L       '<br />'
           '&'nbsp; '&'nbsp;      -M <= I <= +M       '<br />'
          if the pictures are surrounded by frames containing
          the average, where the frame width is M/2 and the
          frame height is L/2.  This can be achieved by use of
          the 'PD' operation.                     '<br />'
          The complete artifact-free CCF is obtained for the
          widths M=NY/2, L=NX/2.  In this case, the padded
          pictures are just twice as large in each dimension as
          the original pictures.

        5. The use of 'CC' with identical input and reference
          files is equivalent to the 'AC' (Auto-Correlation)
          operation.  The input sequence: '<br />'
         
          '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp;     CC       '<br />'
          '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp;     PIC001   '<br />'
          '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp;     PIC001   '<br />'
         
          has the same effect as: '<br />'
         
          '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp;     AC       '<br />'
          '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp;     PIC001   '<br />'
        
       6. If the data cannot fit into the memory, use the 'FT' and 'MU'
          commands to calculate the CCF: '<br />'
          
           '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp;    FT       '<br />'
           '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp;    INPUT1   '<br />'
           '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp;    FOUR1    '<br />'  '<br />'
           '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp;    FT       '<br />'
           '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp;    INPUT2   '<br />'
           '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp;    FOUR2    '<br />'  '<br />'
           '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp;    MU M     '<br />'
           '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp;    FOUR1    '<br />'
           '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp;    FOUR2    '<br />'  '<br />'
           '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp;    FT       '<br />'
           '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp;    FOUR2    '<br />'
           '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp;    CCF12    '<br />'
        

        '<b>'WARNING'</b>': The origin of '<i>'CCF12'</i>' calculated in 
         this way is in (1,1,1).

       7. While using subroutine CCRS_PH_2 (phase correlation) be aware of 
          artifacts that may appear from  harmonics with small amplitude
	  - near zero harmonics have phase undefined. Noise can become a 
	  serious problem, up to making result completely useless.

          This feature allows multiple use of the 'CC' command
          with the same reference:

          Here, REF001 originally contains real data.  On  
          completion of the first 'CC' operation, REF001 contains
          complex data.  The second 'CC' thus saves one Fourier
          transformation.

          do not have to be powers of two (see 'FT MR' for restrictions).

NOTES: 1. The type of the input data can be "R" (real) or "F"
          (Fourier) in any mixed form, i.e.
           '<PRE>'
          "R" for first input and "F" for reference input,
          "F" for first input and "R" for reference input,
          "F" for first input and "F" for reference input,
          "R" for first input and "R" for reference input.

       2. The cross-correlation data are scaled such that a 64x64
          motif padded into a 128x128 matrix, correlated with
          itself gives a peak with value 1 at the origin.  The
          origin is at (NSAM/2 + 1, NROW/2 + 1).
