@CTF ED	Contrast Transfer Function - Estimate Defocus from micrograph  CTF ED
                                                                      06/21/12

PURPOSE: Estimates the 
         '<a href='"'../glossary.html#Defocus'"'>'defocus'</a>', 
         and cutoff frequency of high frequencies based on 2-D power
         spectrum. Outputs defocus parameters to operation line registers and to a line
         in a document file.
         This operation is normally used on a large original micrograph.
        '<b>'The astigmatism calculation was unreliable and has been removed.'</b>'

SEE ALSO: TF  ED
          CTF FIND

USAGE:   CTF ED  [def],[cutoff]
         [The operation line can specify up to two optional register variables:        '<br />'                                                 '<br />'                                                
          The first  (called [def] in this example) receives the overall defocus  
          without taking astigmatism into account.                                     '<br />'
          The second (called [cutoff] in this example) receives the cutoff frequency in 1/A.] 

        .MICROGRAPH IMAGE FILE: MIC001
         [Enter name of the micrograph file.]

        .TILE SIZE, X & Y TILE PERCENT OVERLAP:  500, 20, 20
         [Enter size (in pixels) of tile that is replicated over image to create an average
          power spectrum from the image and the percent overlap between
          adjacent tiles.] 

        .X & Y TILING BORDER: 500, 500
         [Enter size of border around usable part of image (in pixels).] 

	.PIXEL SIZE [A] and SPHERICAL ABBERATION CS [MM]: 2.8, 2
         [Enter pixel size in image (in A) and 
         '<a href='"'../glossary.html#Spherical'"'>'spherical aberration coefficient'</a>' 
         of the objective, usually referred to as CS, (in mm).] 
			
	.ELECTRON VOLTAGE [Kev]: 200
         [Enter the voltage of the electrons (in Kev).]
			
	.AMPLITUDE CONTRAST RATIO [0-1]: 0.1			
         [Enter the amount of 
         '<a href='"'../glossary.html#ACR'"'>'amplitude contrast'</a>'
         (as a fraction).  For ice images this may be about 0.1, 
         for negative stain about 0.15.  Default value is 0.1.]
			
        . DEFOCUS NOISE DOC: DEF_NOISE_001
         [Enter name for document file which will contain 4 register 
          columns of noise information (NOT defocus values). This file will
          be overwritten if it already exists.]

	.OUTPUT DEFOCUS DOCUMENT FILE: CTF_DEFOCUS
         [Enter name for document file which will contain 3 register 
          columns of defocus information. This file will
          be appended to if it already exists.]

        .KEY/IMAGE NUMBER FOR DOCUMENT FILE: 1
         [Enter number of key for defocus document file.]

	.AVERAGE POWER SPECTRUM FILE: AVG_POW
         [Enter name for output file containeng the average power spectrum from
          the tiles.]

NOTES	1. The defocus output document file contains following three register columns: '<br />'
           a) - Key/Micrograph number.                                               '<br />'
           b) - '<a href='"'../glossary.html#Defocus'"'>'Defocus'</a>'.              '<br />'
     	   c) - Cutoff Frequency.                                                    '<br />'

        2. The noise output document file contains following four register columns: '<br />'
           a) - Spatial freqency (1/A).                                             '<br />'
           b) - Estimated background noise: BACKGROUND_NOISE(f)**2.                 '<br />'
           c) - Background-subtracted power spectrum:  
                {CTF(f)*ENV(f)*SIGNAL(f)}**2=PW(f)-BACKGROUND_NOISE(f)**2           '<br />'
     	   d) - Estimated ENV(f)**2                                                 '<br />'
			
   	3. The model of the power spectrum is:
    	   PW(f) = {CTF(f)*ENV(f)*SIGNAL(f)}**2+ BACKGROUND_NOISE(f)**2
		
   	4. For details about this algorithm and cutoff frequency see:
           Z. Huang, P.R. Baldwin, and P. A. Penczek.   Automated
           determination of parameters describing power spectra of 
           micrograph images in electron microscopy. 
          J. Struct. Biology  144,2003,79-94 

        5. Implemented by: Zhong Huang. 

        6. For calculating agstigmatism use the SPIDER operation 
           '<a href='"'ctffind.html'"'>''CTF FIND''</a>'
           which outputs the angle and magnitude of astigmatism as 
           determined by:
           '<a href='"'http://emlab.rose2.brandeis.edu/software'"'>'CTFFIND3'</a>'

        5. When the power spectrum has quite weak CTF imprint, the
           operation will not give astigmatism estimation, and only will 
           give an estimation of the overall defocus and the cutoff frequency.
           In this case the astigmatism astigmatism angle, astigmatism magnitude
           and astigmatism corrected defocus are all reported as zero.

d93 1
a93 2
           both astigmatism and the astigmatism angle still vary from those 
           obtained by this operation for unknown reasons!
