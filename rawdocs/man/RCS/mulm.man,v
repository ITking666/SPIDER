MUL M      Multiply 1st complex file by 2nd conjugated file   MUL M
                                                              11/01/12

PURPOSE:  Multiplies 2D or 3D Fourier transforms 
          in the form of (X) * CONJ(Y). 
          All inputs must have same dimensions.

SEE ALSO: MUL   
          DIV 

USAGE:    MUL M

          .INPUT  FILE: PIC001
          [Enter the name of the first file to be processed.]

          .MULTIPLIER FILE: PIC002
          [Enter the name of the file containing multiplier. Can
           be the same file as the first input.]

          .OUTPUT FILE: PIC999
          [Enter the name of the output file.  Can be the same
           as either input file.]

   SPIDER will ask:

          .MULTIPLIER FILE: *
          [Enter '*' if no more files are to be processed.]

NOTES: 1.  If multiple multiplier files (e.g. PIC002, PIC003, PIC004...)
           are used the final output corresponds to their product:
           PIC999 = PIC001 * PIC002 * PIC003 * PIC004 ...

SUBROUTINES: ADD

CALLER:      UTIL2
