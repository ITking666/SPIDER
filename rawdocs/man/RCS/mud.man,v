MU D      Divide real or complex files                      MU D
                                                            11/01/12

PURPOSE:  Divides an image, volume, Fourier transform by
          one or more divisor images and places result in an output
          file.  All inputs must have same dimensions.
          '<br>' '<b>' OBSOLETE OPERATION NAME, USE 'DIV' INSTEAD!'</b>'

SEE ALSO: DIV
          DIV 2    
          MUL 

USAGE:    MU D

          .INPUT FILE: PIC001
          [Enter the name of the first file to be divided. (Header
           positions from this file are transferred to output.)]

          .DIVISOR FILE: PIC002
          [Enter the name of file containing divisor.  Can be same
           as first file.]

          .OUTPUT FILE: PIC999
          [Enter the name of file for output.  Can be the same
           file as either input.]

   SPIDER will ask:

          .DIVISOR FILE: *
          [Enter '*' if no more files are to be processed.]

NOTES: 1. If multiple divisor files (e.g. PIC001, PIC002, PIC003...)
          are used the final output corresponds to:
          PIC999 = PIC001 / PIC002 / PIC003 ...

NOTES:    1.  PIC001 contains first term of the operation, PIC002 the 
          second term. The result is kept in PIC999.

          2.  "MU D" may only be used for images, volumes, or
          Fourier tranforms having the same dimensions.
