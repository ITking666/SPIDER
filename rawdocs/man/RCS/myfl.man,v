                                                            2/12/01

PURPOSE:  Forces all current output into results file. 

USAGE:    MY FL

NOTES: 1.  Since results file output is buffered, the
           output file contents may lag behind the requested output. 
           This operation will force all pending output into the 
           results file when called.
