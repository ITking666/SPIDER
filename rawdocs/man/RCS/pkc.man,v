PK C       Peak search - Center of gravity                  PK C
                                                            12/4/12

PURPOSE:   Searches for center of gravity of local peaks in image.
           This 'legacy operation" is confusing and may not find correct
           center of gravity if the ellipse axes are unsuited for a particular
           plateau size. 
          '<b>'Obsolete, we advise you use another 'PK' operation instead.'</b>'

SEE ALSO:  PK M
           PK DR    
           PK DC  
           PK 3    
        
USAGE:     PK C [xo],[yo], [pk],[ratio], [xs],[ys], [pks]

           [The first two optional output parameters 
           (in this example [xo],[yo]) specify registers to receive the
           integral location, relative to the center of the image, 
           of the pixel having the maximum value in the image. 
           The third register (here [pk]) receives the peak height of the maximum pixel. 
           The fourth register (here [ratio]) receives the ratio of the peak height 
           relative to the highest peak found  (see option: ORIGIN OVERRIDE).
           The fifth & sixth registers (here [xs],[ys]) receive the sub-pixel locations, 
           relative to the specified origin, of a parabolically fitted peak.
           The seventh register (here [pks]) receives the peak height of the parabolically 
           fitted peak.]

         .INPUT FILE:IMG001
          [Enter the name of the image file.]

          .NUMBER OF PEAKS, CENTER ORIGIN OVERRIDE (0/1): 12, 0
          [Enter the number of peaks to be searched for.  If an  
          origin position other than at the picture's center (NX/2 +
          1, NY/2 + 1) is desired, enter '1' in the second 
          position.  The system will then allow you to enter the X,Y
          coordinates of the origin to be used.]

    If the option 'CENTER ORIGIN OVERRIDE' is specified, SPIDER asks next two questions:

          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .NEW ORIGIN COORDINATES: 1,1
          [Enter the new origin coordinates.]
          '</div>'

          .PEAK NUMBER FOR RATIO: 1
          [Enter the number of the peak relative to which the
          heights of the other peaks are calculated.  This ratio
          is printed out and listed in the document file along
          with the other parameters of the peaks.]
          '</div>'


          .ELLIPSE AXES (X,Y) FOR CGR CALCULATION: 2.5, 3.5
          [Enter the axes of the ellipse limiting the area around 
          each peak, that is used for the center of gravity 
          calculation. (Default for Y=0 is X=Y, assuming a circular
          area.)

          .POSITIVITY ENFORCED? (Y/N): N
          [If 'Y' is answered, first the minimum in the area used for
          the CGR calculation is determined and subtracted from all
          pixels in that area]

          .NEIGHBORHOOD DISTANCE: 5.0
          [Only peaks with a distance greater than the specified 
          neighborhood distance will be reported.]

          .EDGE EXCLUSION WIDTH X, Y: 4, 3
          [Enter the minimum distance (in pixels (integer)) of 
          peaks towards the edge of the image. The program uses 
          the length of the ellipse half-axes for the edge 
          exclusion if values lower than the ones for the CGR 
          elliptical area are given]

          [In the above example, the computer will find the 12
          largest peaks.  Their positions will be printed in the
          RESULTS file, and the value position of the largest peak
          will be printed to the user's terminal.  In addition, the
          peak positions and values will be put into the
          register variables if requested. 

NOTES:    1.  In the above example, the computer will find the 12
          largest peaks.  These positions will be printed in the
          RESULTS file labeled as follows:

          '<table border="0" cellpadding="2">'
          '<th>''<td>'NO'</td>'   '<td>'IX'</td>'  '<td>'IY'</td>'  '<td>'XO'</td>' '<td>'YO'</td>' '<td>'HEIGHT'</td>'  '<td>'RATIO'</td>' '<td>'ERRORS'</td>' '</th>'
          '</table>'

          '<table border="0" cellpadding="1">'
          '<tr>''<td>'NO'</td>'      '<td>'Peak number                               '</td>' '</tr>'
          '<tr>''<td>'IX'</td>'      '<td>'Integer X peak location                   '</td>' '</tr>' 
          '<tr>''<td>'IY'</td>'      '<td>'Integer Y peak location                   '</td>' '</tr>'
          '<tr>''<td>'XO'</td>'      '<td>'Integer X peak location relative to origin'</td>' '</tr>'
          '<tr>''<td>'YO'</td>'      '<td>'Integer Y peak location relative to origin'</td>' '</tr>'
          '<tr>''<td>'HEIGHT'</td>'  '<td>'Peak height                               '</td>' '</tr>'
          '<tr>''<td>'RATIO '</td>'  '<td>'Peak height relative to highest or specified peak '</td>' '</tr>'
          '<tr>''<td>'ERRORS '</td>'  '<td>'If negative value in CGR area'</td>' '</tr>'
          '</table>'

          The sub-pixel offset of a parabolically fitted peak and height of the peak will also
          be printed in the results file. .

          2. The register variables from the command line (if any)
          can be used as input to a subsequent 'SH' (SHIFT) operation.

          3. This routine '<b>'does NOT find'</b>' "maximum" location when image
          has plateaus.  It may even find the "last" value along the
          plateau.  To overcome this use low pass filtration first
          or use 'PK M'.
