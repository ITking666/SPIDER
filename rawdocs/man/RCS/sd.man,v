PURPOSE:   Saves a set of register variables or a comment in a document file. 
           Up to 20 document files remain open until closed with 'SD E'. 

SEE ALSO:  SD E  
           SD IC

USAGE:    SD [key],[r1],[r2],[r3] 
            '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp;  <or>                                   '<br />'

            '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp;  <or>                                   '<br />'
          SD /NEW COMMENT FOR DOC FILE                               '<br />'
           '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp;  <or>                                    '<br />'
          SD //NEW COMMENT FOR DOC FILE                              '<br />'

          .DOCUMENT FILE: DOC001
          [Enter the name of the file where the register contents 
          are to be placed.]

         [There are four somewhat different methods of calling 'SD':        '<br />'
          SD '&'nbsp; [k],[r1],[r2],[r3]                                    '<br />'
          [Using this method the value of [k] is used as a key for storing  
          this register variable set ([r1],[r2],[r3]) in the file. 
          If the contents of the register variables are: 
          [k]=4,  [r1]=30, [r2]=1.5, [r3]=270, 
          then the document file  DOC001 will be appended with a text record 
          containing:                             '<br />'
           '&'nbsp;   4 '&'nbsp;  3 '&'nbsp; 30.0 '&'nbsp; 1.5 '&'nbsp; 270.0                        '<br />'
          where "4" is the key, "3" is the number of registers  
          following the key, and "30.0", " 1.5", and "270.0" 
          are the contents of the register variables [r1],[r2],[r3]           
          in the same sequence as they appear in the 'SD' operation.]         '<br />'  

          SD '&'nbsp; [k],[r1],[r2],[r3]                                      '<br />'
          [Using this method when the value of [k] is negative (and greater than
          -100000000) then the absolute value of [k] is used as a key and
           this line of registers is placed in the document file 
           proceeded by a semicolon similar to a comment.  This allows 
           the input and later retrieval of a limited set of values such 
           as rotation angles which are somehow associated with the 
           contents of the file.  These lines will be treated like 
           comments upon retrieval unless you request the retrieval of 
           the appropriate negative key using 'UD'. This method is referred to
           as storing a comment key in the doc. file. ] 

          SD '&'nbsp; /NEW COMMENT FOR DOC FILE                               '<br />'
          [Using this method, a new comment is added to the document file  
           at the end of the previous contents.                               '<br />'

          SD '&'nbsp; //NEW COMMENT FOR DOC FILE                              '<br />'
          [Using this method, a new comment is added to the document file  
           at the end of the previous contents. The comment can contain
           variables whose values will be substituted   
           (similar to the usage described in the 'VM' operation). 
           Final comment length limited to 160 char.]                         '<br />'

NOTES: 1. Any number of register values can be saved by one 
          operation.  However, the total number of characters on the 
          operation line may not exceed 80. 

       2. The key may be specified directly as a number, e.g.          '<br />'
           '&'nbsp; '&'nbsp;        SD 15,[r1],[r2],[r3]               '<br />'
          No other registers may be specified in this manner.          '<br />'
          Example of an invalid operation:                             '<br />'
           '&'nbsp; '&'nbsp;        SD 15,27.0,[r2],[r3]               '<br />'

       3. The document file can be listed and edited with a text 
          editor as long as one or more blanks are retained between 
          each column of data.  Each update via a run 
          of SPIDER is marked by the date and time of the SPIDER 
          session, as well as the project and data codes used.  

       4. The key may also be the index of a DO-loop.  However, 
          do not use 'X' as an index, as an error will result. 

       5. Information on the actual names of the register variables is 
          lost in the document file. 

       6. Up to 20 document files can be accessed concurrently.  A 
          document file is closed with the 'SD E' operation.  

       7. To decrease the amount of information printed in the 
          results file when using this operation use the 'MD' operation 
          with OPTION: 'VERBOSE OFF'. 

       7. Alternating use of 'SD' and 'UD' for the same file may cause SPIDER
          to get confused as to which document files are open. You will have to
          use 'SD E' and 'UD E' to overcome this confusion. 

       8. Following release: 19.08 the register variables are written with
          13 characters, this should allow more exact specification for integers 
          up to a little beyond: 9,999,999.
