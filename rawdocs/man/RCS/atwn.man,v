AT WN      Automatic particle selection                         AT WN 
              						   03/29/01

PURPOSE:   Written for the automatic particle picking program. It 
           selects only those data windows which are considered to be 
           good particles as decided by the discriminant function.

PURPOSE:   Written for the automatic particle picking program. It windows out
           the particles according to the coordinates in the document file 
           obtained from 'AT PK' after multiplying them by a multiplication factor
           corresponding to that used for reducing the micrograph initially (if
           'AT PK' was used on a image reduced by a factor of 4, then the 
           factor here
           is also 4).When this program is used in the PREPARATION part, it just
           windows out the particles but when used in the SELECTION part, it 
           windows out only those data windows which is considered to be a 
           particle as decided by the discriminant function.

           particles as decided by the function.]
