NOTES:   1. This operation finds the "maximum" location when an image
            has plateaus.  Operation: 'PK' will not do this.
            If there is more than one maximum pixel this is the average of their locations.
            If these pixels are not adjacent this may give non-intuitive location.

         2. If  there is only a single maximal pixel the coordinates are adjusted
             using a parabolic surface to give sub-pixel accuracy.

         3. The bounding box radius is the maximal radius of a bounding box containing 
             all maximal pixels. This radius is zero if there is only a single maximal pixel. 

         4. Maxima occurring on the boundary of the image are included in the calculation.

         5. The RESULTS file contains output as follows:

          '<table border="0" cellpadding="2">'
          '<th>''<td>'NMAX'</td>'   '<td>'X'</td>'  '<td>'Y'</td>'  '<td>'XO'</td>' '<td>'YO'</td>' '<td>'HEIGHT'</td>'  '<td>'RADIUS'</td>' '</th>'
          '</table>'

          '<table border="0" cellpadding="1">'
          '<tr>''<td>'NMAX'</td>'   '<td>'Number of maximum value pixels    '</td>' '</tr>'
          '<tr>''<td>'X'</td>'      '<td>'X peak location relative to image '</td>' '</tr>'

          [The first four optional output parameters (in this example
          [x],[y],[xo],[yo]) specify registers that are to receive
          the coordinates relative to the image ([x] & [y]), and 
          relative to the origin ([xo] & [yo]), of the location of the 
          pixel having the maximium value in the image.  If there is 
          more than one such pixel the coordinates are the center of 
          gravity of the pixels having the maximum value.  The 5th 
          register ([pk]) gets the value of the maximum.  The sixth 
          register ([nm]) gets the number of maximal pixels. If there 
          is only a single maximal pixel the coordinates are adjusted
          using the same method as 'PK' to give sub-pixel accuracy.
          The seventh register ([mr]) gets the maximal radius of a 
          bounding box containing all maximal pixels. (This radius is
          zero if there is only a single maximal pixel.)
