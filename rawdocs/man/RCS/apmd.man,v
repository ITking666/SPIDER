@AP MD     Alignment - Multi reference, rotation   ||   AP MD
                                                              1/28/04

PURPOSE:  Calculates rotational differences between
	  experimental images and a series of reference images.  
          Determines the Eulerian angle for rotation needed to 
          align the experimental image with the "most similar" reference
          image.  Mirrored positions are checked.  This operation 
          forms a main part of the 3D Projection Alignment Method 
          (see usage example appended below).
          '<br>'(See '<a href='"'../align_overview.html'"'>'align_overview.html'</a>' 
          for comparison of 'AP' operations.)
           '<br>' '<b>' OBSOLETE! USE 'AP REF' INSTEAD!'</b>'

SEE ALSO: AP REF 

USAGE:    AP MD

          .TEMPLATE FOR REFERENCE IMAGE SERIES : REF***
          [Give the template name of the existing file series of 2D 
          reference images (typically projections).]

          .FILE NUMBERS OR SELECTION DOC. FILE NAME: SELECTREF
          [Enter numbers of reference files. The file numbers can also
           be read from a selection document file where file numbers are contained in the
           first register (not the keys).]

          .FIRST, LAST RING, & SKIP: 5,15,1
          [Only rings with radii in the range 5-15 will be analyzed. 
           If skip=0 or 1, then every ring between 5 and 15 will be taken;
          for skip=2, every second ring; etc.]

          .REFERENCE-RINGS FILE: REF001
          [Give name of reference-rings file. If the file
           exists, SPIDER will read the  reference-rings data from this 
           file and will not read the reference image file series.  If 
           this file does not exist, SPIDER will create/store  the 
           reference-rings data in incore memory. If 
           SPIDER is unable to allocate sufficient memory for the 
           reference-rings data then the reference-rings file must
           exist. In that case, use operation 'AP I' to create 
           the reference-rings file. More than one 
           SPIDER run can use the same reference-rings file. '<br>'
           Note that old responses 'W', 'Y', & 'N' are now obsolete.

          .TEMPLATE FOR IMAGE SERIES TO BE ALIGNED: DAT***
          [Give the template name of the existing file series of 
          experimental images.  These images will be checked for 
          alignment versus the reference images.]

          .FILE NUMBERS OR SELECTION DOC. FILE NAME:1-21
          [Enter numbers of experimental files. The file numbers can also
           be read from a selection document file where file numbers are contained in the
           first register (not the keys).]

          .OUTPUT ANGLES DOCUMENT FILE: APMD101
          [This is the only output produced by this program.
           It contains 6 columns as follows:                             '<BR>'

            1. Number of the most similar reference image.'<BR>'
               When this number is negative, the most similar image 
               is the mirrored image (see note 1).               '<br>'

            2. Not-normalized correlation coefficient.          '<br>'
               Can be used as a similarity measure.             '<br>'

            3. "-psi" angle.                                    '<br>'
              In-plane rotation angle determined.  To use in 3D
              reconstruction programs invert the sign.

            4. Always 0.0                                       '<br>'

            5. Always 0.0                                       '<br>'

            6. Current experimental image number.               '<br>'

            7. Always -1.0.]                                    '<br>'


NOTE:   1.  In 3D space the projection with the direction: (psi, theta, phi)
            has its mirrored (around X-axis) counterpart in the direction:'<BR>'
                       (-psi, 180-theta, phi+180).'<BR>'
            To save time, the program takes this into account, and each data
            projection is compared with the reference projection and its
            mirrored version at the same time.  Thus, only half of the total 
            number of reference projections are required; namely, only those
            with 0<theta<90.
            If the best match was with the mirrored reference projection,
            then the number stored in the first column of the document file
            is negative (see included batch program).

        2. Images need not have power-of-two dimensions.

        3. The reference projections (of the existing structure)
           can be created using 'VO EA' and 'PJ 3Q' commands.  'VO EA'
           creates an angular document file with quasi-evenly spaced
           projection directions and 'PJ 3Q' creates projections
           of the volume according to this doc file.

        4. The output document file created by 'AP MD' can be converted
           to the angular document file using 'VO MD' command.  Please
           note that in this case the angular document file created
           by 'VO EA' is required.

        5. The operation switches automatically between in-core and on-disk
           versions depending on the memory available.  The  reference
           rings file can be used in either case.

        6. Columns number 4 and 5 in the output document files
           are always filled with zeros and 
           correspond to zero translation.  This is done to keep the
           the document file format the same as in 'AP MD' command. 

        7. The operation is computationally intensive. The code is
           parallel.

        8. An example of the Spider batch program which can be used to produce
           an angular document file from the output document file of this
           command is included in the manual chapter for the command
           'VO MD'.

PURPOSE:  Calculate distances between projections in polar coordinates.
          Determine the three Eulerian angles.
          This operation forms the main part of the 3D Projection Alignment
          Method (see the example appended below).

        6. The operation is computationally intensive. For 5266 reference
           projections it will take 5-15 minutes per data projection.
           The operation can be easily run in a semi-parallel way on a number
           of workstations using the scratch.file created for the given
           reference structure.

; We assume that the 3D structure QUN421 of the size 69x69x69 is available
; and this structure is contained within a sphere of 28 pixels radius.
; The structure has no symmetries and was calculated from 20 2D projections
; PRJ***, whose numbers are stored in the selection document file TOT001,
; while the corresponding Eulerian angles are stored in the angular
; document file ANGLES001.
;
; The program consists of two steps. First is the correction of the
; projections' centrations using crosscorrelation with the projections
; of the structure in the original directions; second is the
; correction of the Eulerian angles using croscorrelation in polar
; coordinates (command AP MD) with the evenly spaced projections
; of the structure.
; Finally, a new, refined 3D structure is calculated.

           spline orders (linearly).

           If the answer 0,0 is given the quadratic interpolation will be

           interpolation and the accuracy is sufficient.]
