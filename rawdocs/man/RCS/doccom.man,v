DOC COMBINE  Combine series of Document files.              DOC COMBINE
                                                               12/11/01

PURPOSE:   Combine contents of a series of document files renumbering

           operation is same as 'DOC MERGE' by column -1  except 
           can merge a whole series of document files.

	   DOC MERGE     
           DOC MIRROR   
           DOC SUBTRACT  

USAGE:    DOC COMBINE
