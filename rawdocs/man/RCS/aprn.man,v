@AP RN     Alignment - multi-reference, restricted projections, no mirror check ||  AP RN

PURPOSE:  Compares a set of experimental images with a set of reference images.
          For each experimental image, it finds the in-plane Euler rotation which
          aligns the experimental image with the most-similar reference image.
	  An experimental image is only compared with reference images  within 
          a restricted angular range. Mirrored positions  are NOT checked.  
          The only difference between this
          operation and 'AP RD' is how they handle mirroring.
           '<br>'(See '<a href='"'../align_overview.html'"'>'align_overview.html'</a>'

           reference-rings data in incore memory. If 
           SPIDER is unable to allocate sufficient memory for the 
           reference-rings data then the reference-rings file must
           exist. In that case, use operation 'AP I' to create 
           the reference-rings file. More than one

          experimental images.  These images will be checked for 
          alignment versus the reference images.]

          .FILE NUMBERS OR SELECTION DOC. FILE NAME:1-21
          [Enter numbers of experimental image files. The file numbers can also
           be read from a selection document file where file numbers are contained in the

          [Experimental images will be compared with only these

       If registers were specified on the operation line then
       no output document file is created.  Instead the registers
       receive the output that normally would be put into the
       document file. This is useful when only a single image is 
       being aligned.

            7. Angular change for projection.]           '<br>'

NOTE:   1. The reference projections (of the existing structure)
           can be created using 'VO EA' and 'PJ 3Q' operations.  'VO EA'
           creates an angular document file with quasi-evenly spaced
           projection directions and 'PJ 3Q' creates projections
           of the volume according to this doc file.

        2. The output document file created by 'AP MD' can be converted
           to the angular document file using 'VO MD' operation.  Please
           note that in this case the angular document file created
           by 'VO EA' is required.

        3. The operation switches automatically between in-core and on-disk
           versions depending on the memory available.  The scratch.file
           is created/required in either case.

        4. The operation switches automatically between in-core and on-disk
           versions depending on the memory available.  The  reference
           rings file can be used in either case.

        5. The operation is computationally intensive. The code is
           parallel.

        6. An example of the SPIDER batch program which can be used to produce
           an angular document file from the output document file of this
           operation is included in the manual chapter for the operation 'VO MD'.

PURPOSE:  Calculate distances between projections in polar coordinates.
          Determine the three Eulerian angles.
          The angular search range is restricted.
          Mirrored positions are NOT checked.
