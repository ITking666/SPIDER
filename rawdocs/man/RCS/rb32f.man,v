RB 32F    Rotate, Shift, Sampled, Back Projection in Fourier space |   RB 32F
                                                              1/10/07

PURPOSE:  Changes the scale, rotates, and shifts image circularly. 
          Then calculates two randomly selected sample recontruction
          and a total-3D reconstruction using interpolation in 
          Fourier space.Rotates counter-clockwise around the center
          (NX/2 + 1, NY/2 + 1). (Negative angles = clockwise.)
          This operation is the same as 'RT SQ' followed by 'BP 32F.
          It is about 5%-10% faster than that operation sequence.
          
SEE ALSO: RT SQ     
          BP 32F
          RB 3F
          BP 3F   

USAGE:    RB 32F

          .TEMPLATE FOR IMAGE FILES (E.G. STK@@****): INSTACK03@@
          [Enter template for the names of the file(s) to be rotated.  
           This template can alternatively refer  
           to a series of single images (e.g. img***), or   
           to a series of stacked images (e.g stack3@@***), or
           to a whole stack of images ending in '@@' (e.g. stk@@).    
           Templates containing an asterisk will have the astericks substituted 
           with a number for the file.]

     If the template contains an asterisk the following question appears:         
          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .FILE NUMBERS OR SELECTION DOC. FILE NAME: 1-700 OR IMAGE_SEL
           [Enter projection file numbers or the name of the document file 
           containing projection file numbers in the first column.]
          '</div>'

          .ANGLES DOC FILE: ANGLES27
          [Enter the name of the document file containing Eulerian
           angles for the projections used (psi, theta, phi) as well as
           the in-plane rotation angle, X shift and Y shift. This data
           must be in the same format as the output from the 'AP SH' or
           'AP REF' operations.]

          .SYMMETRIES DOC FILE: symmetries
          [Enter the name of the document file containing Eulerian angles
           defining symmetries (psi, theta, phi). The angles should be
           such that when used in operation 'RT 3D' transform the volume
           into itself. The identity operation (angles 0,0,0) MUST be included.'<br />'
           The symmetries are enforced in two steps: projections related by the
           symmetry operations are added in Fourier space to the volume; in order
           to reduce the residual artifacts, additional real-space symmetrization
           is applied.                                           '<br />'
           If there are no symmetries, enter symbol "*".]

        .TRANSFORMED OUTPUT IMAGES TEMPLATE (E.G. ROT@@****)',
          [Enter template for the names of the rotated and
           shifted output image files. 
           This template can alternatively refer  
           to a series of single images (e.g. img***), or   
           to a series of stacked images (e.g stack3@@***), or
           to a whole stack of images ending in '@@' (e.g. stk@@).    
           Templates containing an asterisk will have the astericks substituted 
           with a number for the file. However a single asterick will 
           skip any output for these images.]

      If this output template contains an asterick SPIDER asks:

          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'

         .FILE NUMBERS OR SELECTION DOC. FILE NAME: select_03 
          [Enter the file numbers to be substituted into the output file name 
          template or name of a selection document file that contains 
          the file numbers in the first register.]
          '</div>'

      Next SPIDER will always ask the following questions:

          .RECONSTRUCTED VOLUME: VOLUME001
          [Name for the backprojected output volume calculated using all 
           input projections specified in the selection document file.]

          .FIRST SAMPLE VOLUME: VOLUME1001
          [Name for the backprojected output volume calculated from a randomly
           selected set formed from half of the input projections.]

          .SECOND SAMPLE VOLUME: VOLUME2001
          [Name for the backprojected output volume calculated from remaining 
           half of the input projections.]



NOTES: 1. A change of scale will not change the image dimensions.
          All the parameters agree with the output of the
          marker program (operation 
          '<a href='"'mk.html'"'>''MK''</a>').

       2. The input file may be three-dimensional.  In this case, 
          each of the slices is separately rotated and shifted with
          respect to the Z-axis, and stored in the output file, which 
          will be created with the same dimensions.

       3. Shifts can be any real numbers.

       5. The accuracy of interpolation is much higher than that of the
          bilinear interpolation used in the 
          '<a href='"'rt.html'"'>''RT''</a>' operation, but it is 
          lower than the accuracy of bi-spline interpolation. In 
          particular, the derivatives of the interpolated image are 
          not continuous.  The speed, however, is much higher than 
          bi-spline interpolation.

       6. Since quadratic interpolation is used, it is possible for
          the output image min. & max. intensities to be outside the 
          range of the input image.

       7. 5x5x5 Kaiser-Bessel interpolation scheme is used.

       8. Sample volumes can be used to evaluate the resolution.  The division of
          projection data set is performed in a random manner.  Therefore, the two
          sample volumes will be different if the command is repeated on the same
          data set.
           
       9. If you do not have enough memory in your computer to use
          this operation substitute 'RB 3F' instead and invoke it
          three times to create the various output volumes.

      10. This operation is NOT parallelized for use with MPI.

      11. Implemented by Paul Penczek and ArDean Leith.

      12. This operations was created because it was faster than 
          consecutive invocations of 'RT SQ' and 'BP 32F'.  However 
          multi-processor / multi-core machines have taken away the
          speed advantage. (al 2010)
