CL HC     Classification - Controlled                     CL HC   
                                                           5/30/09

PURPOSE:  To find clusters of images/elements in factor space 
          (or a selected subspace) by using Diday's method of 
          moving centers, and to apply hierarchical ascendant 
          classification (HAC) using one of several methods 
          to the resulting cluster centers.  '<br />'
          Reads input from 'CA S' operation. '<br />' 
          Produces a Postscript dendrogram plot and a dendrogram 
          description doc. file.  These
          files can be used to determine the images/elements assigned
          to each class (cluster).'<br />'
          See: '<a href='"'../techs/classification/tutorial.html'"'>'Classification and Clustering Tutorial'</a>' 
          for further info.

NOTES:  1.  The RESULTS file contains the following information: '<br />''<br />'

          A) Aggregation history:                               '<br />'
             For each of the NP partitions, the NS seeds and sizes of
             clusters are listed.  The non-empty clusters in the crossed  
             partition are given by size and cummulative percentage.  A 
             total of NS**NP clusters are possible, but in practice, only
             10% of these are non-empty.                        '<br />''<br />'

          B) Description of hierarchy nodes:                    '<br />'
             The nodes are numbered starting from the number of the highest
             cluster.  For each node, the Senior, Junior, size, weight
             and hierarchy index are given.  The hierarchy index is printed
             out as a histogram.                                '<br />''<br />'

          C) Description of the classes:                        '<br />'
             For each node the constituent classes are listed.  '<br />''<br />'

          D) Dendrogram:                                        '<br />'
             The class relationships are represented in the form of a     
             dendrogram (tree structure).  The lengths of the branches (in
             horizontal print direction) are proportional to the heirarchy
             indices.                                           '<br />''<br />'

          E) List of class members:                            '<br />'
             The members are listed for each of the basic 
              non-empty classes.                               '<br />''<br />'

          F) List of class center coordinates:                 '<br />'
             For each class, the NFAC coordinates of its center is listed.
             These are contained in the cluster file.          '<br />''<br />'

          G) Re-classification lookup table:                   '<br />'
             Each cutoff point in the dendrogram, from right to left, defines
             a new classification scheme with the number of classes increasing
             by 1 each time.  The table gives the new class memberships for
             any cutoff point selected.                        '<br />''<br />'

       2. To get the classification on a given "cutting" level use
          operation:  '<a href='"'clhd.html'"'>''CL HD''</a>'.

       3. To get the selection doc files corresponding to the given 
          "cutting" use operation: 
           '<a href='"'clhe.html'"'>''CL HE''</a>'.

       4. To calculate averages for the classes use operation 
           '<a href='"'asdc.html'"'>''AS DC''</a>' and
          selection doc. files.

       5.  Every vertical line at the bottom of the dendrogram (with no cutoff)
           represents an image that you input into 'CA S'.  Each vertical line 
           is an average of the images, or vertical lines, below it.       '<br />'

	   The threshold is a scaled value from 0 to 100 that informs 'CL HC'
           how far "up" the dendrogram you wish it to look. A
	   threshold set at the bottom would result in the number of classes
	   being equal to the number of input images. A median threshold value
	   of 50 results in fewer classes. And a top level 
	   threshold gives a single class containing of all the inputs.

       6. With untruncated results and/or very many classes the Postcript
          plot lines/labels may be overwritten, sorry.

       7. Originally implemented by P. Penczek.
