WV P      Window averaging - over Patches                         WV P
                                                               3/2/89

PURPOSE:  Correlation averaging of crystalline lattices:

          [This operation assumes that the first step of correlation
          averaging has been completed: use of 'CC' (compute 
          cross-correlation) and 'PK C' (peak search with center-of-gravity
          option) to obtain a ranked list of peak coordinates 
          indicating the locations of the repeats of the unit cell.]

          Partition large raw file into regular patches.  Window out 
          areas from raw file, according to X,Y coordinates in peak
          search document file, and sum these separately according to
          their patch location.  An average is created for each patch.
          The resulting stack of "patch averages" is stored in 3-D
          format in a single output file.  The individual averages
          may be retrieved by the operation 'PS Z' (Pick Slice in Z
          direction).
          
          Reference: see J. Frank, W. Chiu, and L. Degn, 
          '<I>'Ultramicroscopy'</I>'26 (1988) 345-360.

          WV S  
  
USAGE:    WV P

          .SCANNED DATA FILE: RAW001
          [Enter the name of the large data file to be used as input]

          .AVERAGE FILE: AVE001
          [Enter the name of the file where the stack of averages is 
          to be kept.  The file will be opened with a 3-D data format,
          where NX, NYW are the dimensions of the data window, to
          be specified in the next query, and NZ is the number of
          patches to be specified below]

          .WINDOW DIMS NX,NY: 64,64
          [Enter the dimensions of the data window to be selected at 
          each peak location (= dimensions of the average created for
          each patch)]

          .PATCH DIMENSIONS: 200,200
          [Enter the size of the patch.  In order not to loose data 
          close to the edges of the patch, the following relationship
          should be observed in both dimensions:  
                 PATCH SIZE = INCREMENT + WINDOW SIZE]

          .NUMBER OF PATCHES, GENERATE PATCHES?(0/1): 100,1
          [Enter the total number, NPATCH, of patches to be used, and 
          select the way the patches are specified: 
          GENERATE PATCHES=0: patch coordinates are supplied for NPATCH
                              patches;
          GENERATE PATCHES=1: patch coordinates are generated by the 
                              program based on a regular grid.]

          Option '0':
          In this case, NPATCH pairs of numbers must be supplied:

          .INTEGER CORNER COOS OF PATCHES: 10,20 310,20 540,50
          540,490 ...
          [In each pair, the first number is interpreted as the x
          coordinate, the second as y coordinate.  The pairs of 
          numbers may be entered in free format, on consecutive lines 
          if necessary.  The choice of patch positions can be totally 
          arbitrary.

          Option '1':
          In this case, NPATCH pairs of coordinates are generated by
          the program according to the INCREMENT specification:

          .STARTING COOS: 10,50
          [give the x,y coordinates of the first patch]

          .INCREMENTS X,Y: 136,136
          [give the patch position increments in x and y direction.
          Beginning with the STARTING COOS, a regular rectangular
          grid is created which defines the patches. Patches are
          counted from left to right, top to bottom, in the way a
          book is read.  This means that the average of the top
          left patch will be the first slice in the AVERAGE FILE,
          the average of the bottom right patch will be stored as
          the last slice.]      

    
          The NUMBER OF PATCHES USED will be printed out, followed
          by a list of patch coordinates to be used.
          Note that for the GENERATE PATCHES=1 option, the NUMBER
          OF PATCHES USED may be different from the NUMBER OF PATCHES
          specified earlier, because it is calculated from the 
          STARTING COOS and INCREMENT coordinates.

        
          .DOCUMENT FILE: DOC001
          [Enter the name of the document file containing the peak 
          coordinates. The document file must contain the peak
          values in the following sequence: KEY, X, Y, HEIGHT. 
          In this way they are created by operation 'PK C']

          The following message appears: 

                ** NUMBER OF PEAKS IN DOCUMENT FILE  <NPEAK>

          where <NPEAK> is the number of peaks retrieved from the
          Document file. [This number may be different from the 
          the total number of peaks stored by 'PK C' in the file,
          because the peak information is read back into core
          using an in-core unsave routine which is currently
          limited to 1000 keys.]

          .PEAK VALUES (FROM, TO): 0., 1.4
          [this allows the absolute range of peak heights to be 
          limited.  Peaks with values outside this range will be
          excluded.]

          .RANGE OF RANKS IN PERCENT (FROM,TO; 100=BEST): 60,100
          [enter the rank range, in terms of percentage of total
          number of peaks, of peaks to be used. A specification
          of 0,0 will cause all peaks to be accepted within the
          PEAK VALUES window.  It will also cause rank sorting
          by decreasing size to be skipped, which will not be
          noticed unless the document file was prepared by a
          non-standard method (i.e., not by 'PK C').] 

          The following message appears:

               ** <NPK> PEAKS BETWEEN <THL> AND <THH> READ IN

          where <NPK> is the number of peaks in the absolute value
          range (<THL>,THH>) specified above.

          .X-OFFSET, Y-OFFSET: 100,500
          [this allows the use of a raw data file that is a portion
          of the original file for which the peak list has been
          generated.  If both are identical, specify 0,0]

          .SCALE FACTOR: 2.
          [if the CCF is based on a reduced version of the original
          raw data file, the geometric scaling factor has to be
          used to re-scale coordinates of the peak positions to the
          actual coordinates of the unit cell repeats in the raw 
          data file. If both CCF and raw data file are on the same 
          scale, use 1.]


          Next, the following messages appear: '<BR>'

               ** NUMBER OF PEAKS AFTER COO CHECK = <NPKCK>

          where <NPKCK> is the number of peaks left after the
          outside margin of the raw data field has been taken into
          account;'<BR>'

               ** NUMBER OF PEAKS WITHIN RANK RANGE = <NPKR>'<BR>'

          where <NPKR> is the number of peaks left after the
          additional rank limitation has been applied.

         
          .NO. OF PEAKS TO USE, DUMP? (0=NO; 1=YES; 2=FULL): 800,0
          [of the <NPKR> peaks left, the highest NPEAK peaks may
          be selected.  If no selection is requested, specify a
          number that is large enough; e.g. the original number
          of peaks.  The DUMP option is only used for special
          debugging purposes.  Do not use it, because the amount
          of print output may be staggering!]
     
          At the end of the program run, the following information
          is given:'<BR>'

               ** DIMENSION OF CCF WINDOW USED: <NXC>, <NYC> '<br />'

          where <NXC>, <NYC> are the X and Y dimensions of the
          raw data field after edge exclusion;'<BR>'

               ** NUMBER OF WINDOWS IN EACH PATCH'<BR>'
                  20  19  20  21  ...

          This number is not necessarily constant because the crystal
          grid and the patchwork grid normally "beat" each other. 
          Another reason would be the existence of poor areas within
          the field, which would cause a drop in the number of good
          peaks found.
          The numbers of windows are printed out for completeness, 
          because they give an account for changes of statistics 
          from one patch to the next.
