EC CLOSE  Extract Connected Clusters - merge close clusters    EC CLOSE 
							        5/29/13

PURPOSE:  Merges neighboring clusters of voxels in a 3D volume into
          a single "object" or lower hierarchical-level cluster.  '<br />'

          Reads a SPIDER document file containing cluster centers
          of mass.   Determines distances between all clusters. If the 
          distance between two clusters is less than the solicited 
          threshold, it sets higher-numbered cluster voxels to the 
          same identification number posessed by the lower-numbered cluster.

USAGE:    EC CLOSE

          [Contains cluster numbers and centers of masses.  Usually
           prepared using operation 'EC STAT' The document file needs

          .THRESHOLD DISTANCE & INITIAL CLUSTER: 15, 2
          [Clusters closer together than specified threshold distance
          are given same cluster number.  Clusters below the  
          the initial cluster number are ignored.]
