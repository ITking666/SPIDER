FF        Filter - Fourier                                  FF      
                                                            11/29/12

PURPOSE:  Applies filters to 2-D or 3-D Fourier transforms. If you 
          want to filter a real image (not a Fourier image) use operation
          'FQ' instead.

SEE ALSO:  FF PLOT  
           FD
           FP      
           FQ      
           FT       

USAGE:    FF

          .INPUT FILE:  FOU001
          [Enter name of input image file which contains a Fourier transform.]

          .OUTPUT FILE: FOU002
          [Enter name for output file which will receive the filtered Fourier file.]

          .FILTER TYPE (1-11): 3
          [Enter filter option code.

           Option "1" - Low-pass truncation.  Filter is a "Top-hat" function
                        that truncates Fourier transform at spatial frequency: '<i>'SPF'</i>'.

           Option "2" - High-pass truncation.  Filter is inverse "Top-hat"
                        function that passes Fourier transform beyond spatial
                        frequency: '<i>'SPF'</i>'.

           Option "3" - Gaussian low-pass.  Filter is Gaussian function:
                        EXP(-'<i>'F'</i>'**2 / (2 * '<i>'SPF'</i>'**2)), 
                        where '<i>'F'</i>' is the frequency.

           Option "4" - Gaussian high-pass.  Filter is complement of Gaussian function:
                        1 - EXP(-'<i>'F'</i>'**2 / (2 * '<i>'SPF'</i>'**2)),
                        where '<i>'F'</i>' is the frequency.

           Option "5" - '<a href='"'../img/fermi_lopass.jpg'"'>'Fermi low-pass'</a>'.  Filter is:      
                        1 / (1 + EXP[('<i>'F'</i>' - '<i>'SPF'</i>') / '<i>'T'</i>']) which
                        negotiates between "Top-hat" and Gaussian
                        characteristics, depending on the value of the temperature:
                        '<i>'T'</i>' (see below).

           Option "6" - '<a href='"'../img/fermi_hipass.jpg'"'>'Fermi high-pass'</a>' high-pass.  Filter is: 
                        1 / (1 + EXP[('<i>'F'</i>' - '<i>'SPF'</i>') / '<i>'-T'</i>'])
                        (Same as in Option "5", but with '<i>'T'</i>' replaced by '<i>'-T'</i>').

           Option "7" - Butterworth low-pass. Filter is:  
                        1 / (SQRT(1 + '<i>'F'</i>' / '<i>'RAD'</i>')**(2 * '<i>'ORDER'</i>'))  '<br />'
                        where                                                                  '<br />'

                        In the Butterworth filter the '<i>'ORDER'</i>' determines
                        the filter fall off and '<i>'RAD'</i>' corresponds to the cut-off radius. '<br />'
                        Frequencies below the lower frequency are preserved,                      '<br />'
                        frequencies above the upper frequency are removed,                        '<br />'
                        with a smooth transition in between lower and upper
                        limiting frequencies.
                        
           Option "8" - Butterworth high-pass. Filter is: 
                        1 - (1 / (SQRT(1 + '<i>'F'</i>' / '<i>'RAD'</i>')**(2 * '<i>'ORDER'</i>'))) '<br />'
                        Frequencies below the lower frequency are removed,    '<br />'
                        frequencies above upper frequency are preserved,      '<br />'
                        with a smooth transition in between lower and upper
                        limiting frequencies.
   
           Option "9"    Multiplication by the Remez filter designed with the help
                        of 'FF PLOT' command.

           Option "10"   B Factor: normalizes amplitudes by a 'B' temperature factor. '<br />'

    For options "1-6" SPIDER asks:
          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .FILTER RADIUS (IN FREQUENCY OR PIXEL UNITS): 0.12 or 5
          [The filter radius (filter intrinsic frequency) can be input using either
           frequency units or pixel units. If filter radius is given in
           frequency units, they should be in the range: 0.0 - 0.5.
           If the input is > 1.0 it is treated as given in pixel units.]
           This value expressed as a frequency is denoted: '<i>'SPF'</i>'.]
          '</div>'

    For options "5-6" SPIDER asks:
          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .TEMPERATURE (0=CUTOFF): 0.3
          [Enter  a temperature parameter '<i>'T'</i>'
           The filter falls off roughly within this reciprocal distance (in terms of frequency units).]
          '</div>'

    For options "7-8" SPIDER asks:
          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
         .LOWER & UPPER LIMITING FREQUENCIES (IN FREQ OR PIXEL UNITS): 0.1, 0.2 
          [The Filter limiting frequencies can be given either in  frequency units or
          pixel units. If limiting frequencies are given in frequency units, they should 
          be in the range: 0.0 - 0.5. If limiting frequencies are > 1.0 
          they are treated as given in pixel units. Both values must be in the same units. 
          These values expressed as frequencies are denoted: '<i>'Flow'</i>' and '<i>'Fup'</i>'.]
          '</div>'

    For option "9" SPIDER asks:

          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .FILTER FILE: REM000
          [This file can be created by 'FF PLOT', or it can be any
           Fourier file used as a filter.]
          '</div>'

    For option "10" SPIDER asks:

          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .B FACTOR: 0.5

          .D CONSTANT: 1

          .FQ CUTOFF: 0.4
          [Where the new amplitude is the original amplitude mutltiplied: '<br />'
           AMP = AMP * D * (EXP(B * s**2))  when  's**2' is below the FQ**2 cutoff and
           unchanged when above the FQ**2 cutoff. (See source code for details.)
]
          '</div>'

NOTES:    1.  '<a href='"'fq.html'"'>''FQ''</a>' has similar functions.

          2. The FILTER RADIUS and LOWER & UPPER LIMITING FREQUENCIES can be given either in 
             frequency units ('<i>'F'</i>') or pixel units ('<i>'P'</i>'). 
             If the input is > 1.0 it is treated as given in pixel units.          '<br />'                                '<br />'
             Frequency units are absolute units (independent of image size)
             in the range: 0.0 - 0.5 (0.5 is the highest value).                         '<br />'
             The following equations  convert frequency
             units into pixel units for ('<i>'P'</i>' in range: 0 - (NX/2)):       '<br />'
             '<i>'P'</i>' = '<i>'F'</i>' * NX                                      '<br />'
             '<i>'F'</i>' = '<i>'P'</i>' / NX                                      '<br />'

          (1)  Low-pass truncation.  Filter is "top-hat" function
               that truncates Fourier transform at spatial frequency
               RAD.

          (2)  High-pass truncation.  Filter is inverse "top-hat"
               function that passes Fourier transform beyond spatial
               frequency radius RAD.

          (3)  Gaussian low-pass.  Filter is Gaussian function
               EXP(-f**2/(2.*RAD**2)), where F is the frequency.

          (4)  Gaussian high-pass.  Filter is complement of Gaussian
               function:  1.0 - EXP(-F**2/(2.*RAD**2)).

          (5)  Fermi low-pass.  Filter is 1/(1+EXP[(F-RAD)/T]) which
               negotiates between "top-hat" and Gaussian 
               characteristics, depending on the value of T (see below).

          (6)  Fermi high-pass.  Same as low-pass, but T is replaced by -T.

          (7)  Butterworth low-pass. Frequencies below pass band are
               preserved, frequencies above stop band are removed, with
               a smooth transition in between (pass band < stop band).
               Filter is:  1/(SQRT(1+F/RAD)**(2*ORDER))    '<br />'
               In the actual implementation of the filter the parameters,
               RAD and ORDER are calculated from the pass-band frequency
               and cut-off frequency specified by the user.
               Frequencies above pass band are
               preserved, frequencies below stop band are removed, with
               a smooth transition in between (pass band > stop band).
               See NOTE 3 below.

          2. The FILTER RADIUS can be given either in absolute units or pixel
          units. If answer is >1.0 it is treated as given in pixel units.

          3. In the Butterworth filter the ORDER determines
             the filter fall off and RAD corresponds to the cut-off radius.
             In the program RAD and ORDER are calculated from the parameters
             specified by the user using following equations:'<br>'
             
             RAD = fp/((eps)**(2/ORDER))                    '<br>'

             ORDER = [2*log(eps/sqrt(a**2-1))]/[log(fp/fs)]'<br>'

             where fp and fs are the pass-band and stop-band frequencies and 
             parameters "eps" and "a" are given by 0.882 and 10.624 resp. 
             Note that fp and fs deviate from 1.0 and 0.0 by about 0.2 and 0.09
             respectively (for a low-pass filter.)

                        In the actual implementation of the filter the parameters,

                        and cut-off frequency specified by the user.
                        Frequencies above pass band are
                        preserved, frequencies below stop band are removed, with
