NOTES:   1. A non-linear contrast stretch mapping function is 
            computed by integrating the histogram of the image, 
            and applied to the data in the input file. 
            The density mapping function and histograms before and after 
            stretching can be printed out.

                      A non-linear contrast stretch mapping function is 
                      computed by integrating the histogram of the image, 
                      and applied to the data in PIC001. The histogram 
                      equalized image is placed in PIC002. The density 
                      mapping function and histograms before and after 
                      stretching will be printed out.

           Option 'L' for enhancement depending on local histogram.'<BR>'
                      For each point in the input image, a local 
                      histogram is computed within a square area of 
                      specified size.  Contrast enhancement is performed 
                      depending on the shape of local histogram.]

    If 'S' (Contrast Stretching)  SPIDER then asks:

           .(S)INGLE, (A)UTOMATIC OR (D)OUBLE MAPPING? (S/A/D):  S/A/D
           [Option 'S' for single mode stretching (= normal mode)'<BR>'
                       The contrast is linearly stretched between bottom  
                       and top density specified.  These values can be 
                       determined from a histogram output (see 'HI').

            Option 'A' for automatic single mode stretching.'<BR>'
                       The contrast is linearly stretched between bottom
                       and top density.  These values are determined
                       from an integral threshold specification in the
                       following way:  the integrals over the histogram
                       from the right- and left-hand sides are compared
                       with a specified fraction of the total histogram
                       area (= total number of points).  The bottom and
                       top densities are defined as the density values
                       where the left- and right-hand integrals, 
                       respectively, become equal to the specified 
                       fraction.

            Option 'D' for Double mode stretching.'<BR>'
                       The contrast is linearly stretched in two sections 
                       of the histogram specified by BOTTOM1, TOP1, BOTTOM2,
                       TOP2.]

    If 'S' (Single) SPIDER then asks:

           [Enter density value that is to be mapped to 0.0]

           .TOP DENSITY VALUE: 1.2
           [Enter density value that is to be mapped to 2.0]

           [The contrast stretched image will then be computed
           and put into PIC002.  The density, mapping function, 
           and the histograms before and after stretching will be 
           printed out.]

     If 'A' (Automatic) SPIDER then asks:

           .INTEGRAL THRESHOLD PERCENT: .5
           [Enter percentage of total histogram area to be
           used for definition of top and bottom density.]

           [Indicate if the histogram of the stretched image
           is to be computed and printed out.]

           [The contrast stretched image will then be computed and put 
           into PIC002.  The following info will be printed out:
           1.  The histogram before stretching, if this is newly computed.'<BR>'
           2.  The density mapping function.                              '<BR>'
           3.  The histogram after stretching if this option is chosen.   '<BR>'

    If 'D' (Double Mapping) SPIDER asks:
  
           .BOTTOM1: 0.1
           [Enter density value of first lobe to be mapped into 0.]

           .TOP1: 0.3
           [Enter density value of first lobe to be mapped into 2.]

           .BOTTOM2: 0.6
           [Enter value of second lobe to be mapped into 0.]

           .TOP2: 0.8
           [Enter value of second lobe to be mapped into 2.]

           [SPIDER checks if BOTTOM1 < TOP1 < BOTTOM2 < TOP2.
           If the values are not ordered in this way, an
           error message will be printed out.
           As in A.1. and A.2., the contrast stretched image
           will then be computed and put into PIC002.
           The density mapping function and the histograms
           before and after stretching will be printed out.]

    If 'H'  (Histogram Equalization)  SPIDER asks:  

           .MAPPING F AND HIST. PRINTOUT? (Y/N): Y/N
           [Enter 'Y' if you want to have a display of mapping
           function and histogram after enhancement.]

            Option 'T' for Threshold Discrimination Depending On Local
                       Histogram Information.  The pixel density is
                       switched to 0. or 2. depending on whether its
                       original value is smaller or larger than a density
                       value marking a specified fraction of the
                       total histogram area.]

    If 'G' (Generalized - Local Histogram Equalization) SPIDER asks:  

           .LOCAL AREA SIZE: 7
           [Enter linear size of local area (odd).]

           [The processed image will be found in PIC002.  No
