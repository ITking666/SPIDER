BP RP 3   Back Projection - 3D, iterative, Richardson, constrained  ||*  BP RP 3  
                                                             8/28/12

PURPOSE:  Calculates two sample reconstructions from randomly selected 
          subsets containing half of the total projections and a 
          a total-3D reconstruction from all the projections 
          using Richardsons constrained method.  This operation 
          is the same as 'BP RP' with the addition of the two randomly 
          selected sample reconstructions.
          Only works for square projection images.

          See: '<a href='"'../bp_overview.html'"'>'Comparison of 'BP' operations'</a>'. 

SEE ALSO: BP RP  
          BP CG 
          BP 3F 
          BP 3D  
          BP R2   
          BP RP  
          BP S2 
          BP W2 

USAGE:    BP RP 3 [niter]       '<br />'
          [Optional register variable receives the number of 
          iterations during the overall reconstruction.]

          .TEMPLATE FOR IMAGE FILES: PROJ***
          [Enter template for projection image input files.]

          .FILE NUMBERS OR SELECTION DOC. FILE NAME: 1-700 
           [Enter image file numbers or the name of a document 
           file which contains the image file numbers in its 
           first register column.]

          .RADIUS OF RECONSTRUCTED OBJECT: 23
          [Enter radius of reconstructed object (smaller than half the
           volume size, see below for further restrictions). 
           The reconstruction is calculated inside the sphere only.]

          .ANGLES DOC FILE: ANGLESDOC
          [Enter name of the document file which contains Eulerian
           angles:  psi, theta, and phi in the first three registers
           columns. These angles specify the projection directions.]
                
	  .SYMMETRIES ANGLES DOC FILE: ANGSYMDOC
           [Enter '<b>'*'</b>' if the structure has no symmetries. '<br />'
           Otherwise, enter the name of the document file containing
           Eulerian angles defining symmetries (psi, theta, phi). The
           angles should be such that when used in operation 'RT 3D'
           they transform the volume into itself.  The identity
           operation (angles 0,0,0) MUST be included.  The symmetries
           will be internally enforced on the volume.  The
           reconstruction in this case is calculated as though the
           projections were multiplied as many times as there are
           symmetries.]
              
          .RECONSTRUCTED VOLUME FILE: VOL001
           [Enter name for the output file. Enter '<b>'*'</b>' if 
            you do not want any overall reconstructed volume file.]

          .FIRST SAMPLE VOLUME: VOL001_1
          [Name for the output volume calculated from a randomly
           selected set formed from half of the input projections.]

          .SECOND SAMPLE VOLUME: VOL001_2
          [Name for the output volume calculated from remaining half of the 
           input projections.]

          .LAMBDA, CORRECTION LIMIT: 1.0e-4, 0.0
          ['<b>'Lambda'</b>' determines the weight of corrections. Too small a
           value results in long time of calculations; too large
           value will terminate the iterations too soon. (Note #2). '<br />'
           '<b>'Correction limit'</b>' can be used to terminate the iterations.
           When the squared correction of the structure becomes
           smaller than the preset value, the iterations are
           terminated.  When correction limit is set to zero,
           it will not be used to terminate the program.  Iteration limit will
           be used instead.] 

          .ITERATION LIMIT, MODE: 25, 8
          [Program will terminate after number of iterations given. '<br />'
           Mode determines the constraint(s) used: '<br />'
           0 - No constraints.                     '<br />'
           1 - Smoothing.                          '<br />'
           2 - Min constraint.                     '<br />'
           3 - Smoothing & min constraints.        '<br />'
           4 - (No mode 4)                         '<br />'
           5 - Max constraint.                     '<br />'
           6 - Smoothing & max constraints.        '<br />'
           7 - Min & max constraint.               '<br />'
           8 - Smoothing, min, & max constraints.  '<br />'
           Any combination of constraints can be used. The mode value
           should be the sum of any single modes, for example mode=7
           activates both min and max constraints, while mode=8 uses all three of 
           them. Constraints are ignored if mode=0, but dummy values should
           still be entered on the next two lines.]

          .MINIMUM, MAXIMUM: 1.77, 1.90
          [Values of min and max constraints: i.e., the max and min values of
           the 2D projection data set.  Constraints are ignored if mode=0, 
           but dummy values must still be entered.]

          .SMOOTHING CONSTANT (0-0.999): 0.9994
          [Smoothing constant determines relative weight of the low-pass
           filtration. See note #4. Constraints are ignored if mode=0, 
           but a dummy value must still be entered.]

NOTES:    1. If the radius of the reconstructed circle is too large
             compared to the size of projections, a warning is printed.
             The reconstruction is calculated, but it is incorrect
             along the boundary.

          2. Lambda is used to control the speed of convergence. '<br />'

             Too small value of lambda will result in a structure
             that has high frequencies under-represented.  The structure
             will appear very smooth.  Moreover, when such structures are
             used to estimate the resolution (operation 'RF 3') the Fourier
             Shell Correlation curve, after initial decrease, will increase
             in high frequencies region.  To remedy the problem, the
             lambda has to be increased (Try: 10 times).               '<br />'
             An ever smaller value of lambda value of lambda will give Fourier
             Shell Correlation curve that remains abnormally high for a long
             distance .  To remedy this problem,  lambda has to be increased 
             (Try: 100-1000 times).                                     '<br />'

             Too large value of lambda will terminate iterations too
             soon, earlier than requested number of iterations,
             usually after the first two or three steps.  This can be verified
             in the output stored in the results file.  The '<b>'resulting 
             structure will be incorrect.'</b>'  To remedy this problem
             lambda has to be decreased (Try: 2 times) and the operation 
             has to be repeated.  If the problem persists, lambda
             has be decreased again until the requested number of
             iterations is performed.

          3. The smoothing constant determines relative weight of the 
             low-pass filtration. It has to be larger than zero and smaller than one.
             In addition the smoothing constant has to be lower than:
                1/(1+6*lambda).                

             Zero means no smoothing.                             '<br />'

             To achieve stronger low-pass filtration effect one can 
             decrease lambda and increase the smoothing constant. '<br />'

             Approximate frequency response:

             '<table cellpadding="4">'
             '<tr>' '<th>'Lambda'</th>''<th>'Smoothing constant '</th>''<th>'Res'n limit (pixels)'</th>''</tr>'
             '<tr>' '<td>' .5E-3'</td>''<td>' 0.990'</td>''<td>'   3'</td>''</tr>'
             '<tr>' '<td>' .5E-3'</td>''<td>' 0.997'</td>''<td>'   5'</td>''</tr>'
             '<tr>' '<td>' .1E-3'</td>''<td>' 0.9994'</td>''<td>' 10'</td>''</tr>'
             '</table>'

          4. It is assumed that projections are squares (NX=NY), so
             the output volume will have dimensions NX x NX x NX.

          5. This operation parallelized for use with MPI.

          6. Implemented by: Paul Penczek '&'amp; ArDean Leith.
             Fourier-based-spline Interpolation by G. Kishchenko.

          7. By using: 'BP RP 3L' this operation will request lists
             of sample images instead of creating random lists.  This
             can be used to force same output over multiple trials.
             A similar effect can be accomplished with 
             '<a href='"'md.html'"'>'MD''</a>' using
             suboption 'SET SEED'
