PP P      Put Points in image - from Document file, alters neighbors   PP P
                                                               06/20/96

PURPOSE:  Reads locations from a document file and places a value 
          into the specified image file at that location.   The pixel
          value (intensity) is also read from the document file.
          The four pixels surrounding this location are set to the
          maximum value previously found in the file.  This is
          apparently useful for marking images with the peak locations
          found by correlation.  Use 'PP P' if you do not want to
          alter the nearest four locations also.

USAGE:    PP P 

          .INPUT FILE: CCF001
          [Enter the name of the image file to be marked]

          .DOCUMENT FILE: DOC001
          [Enter name of document file where values to be interpreted
          as coordinates are located.]

          .XCOL, YCOL: 2,4
          [Enter the registercolumns of the document file where the values
          are stored that are to be interpreted as X,Y coordinates,
          respectively.  Note that a 0 specification for XCOL will
          cause the keys to be used as x-positions.]

          .HEIGHT COLUMN: 5
          [Enter the register column of the document file where the values
          of the peak height are stored.]

          .XFACTOR, YFACTOR: 1.,1.
          [Enter scaling factors to be applied in x and y directions.
          If the output dimensions specified are equal to the
          dimensions of the file where the coordinates originated,
          XFACTOR=1 and YFACTOR=1 would be the normal specification.
          However, for histogram plotting (see example below),
          use XFACTOR=1, YFACTOR=-NY, where NY is the number of rows
          specified for the output file.  The minus sign inverts the
          y-direction so that a plot with conventional axes directions
          is obtained.]

          .KEYS TO BE USED:  1-25,28
          [Enter the keys of the document records you wish to use.
          Keys are normally numbers of particles, iteration counts,
          or ranks of peaks in a correlation search.]

NOTES:1.  Following is an example for the use of 'PP' to plot a
          histogram of a set of values (e.g., correlation peak values)
          stored in a specified column of a document file:

          Let's assume the peak values have been stored by a previous
          operation in column 4 of document file DOC001.  The file
          contains 150 entries stored under keys 1-150, all of which
          should be used in the plot.  The peak values are relative to
          the value of the first (highest) peak; i.e., their value
          range is 0 to 1.

          First, the image into which the plot is to be inserted
          must be created, e.g. by operation 'BL'.
          In our example, the x-dimension of the image repre-
          senting the plot should be chosen as 150 (corresponding to
          1 pixel per data point).  The y-dimension can be chosen
          arbitrarily, its choice is governed only by aesthetic and
          layout considerations.  Let's say 50 has been chosen.  The
          correct command sequence for drawing a histogram is:

'<PRE>'
             BL
             HIS001
             150,50
             N
             0.

             PP
             HIS001
             DOC001
             0,4
             4
             1.,-50.
'</PRE>'

          2.  FMIN and FMAX are correct upon leaving this routine, 
              however, AVD and SIG are not.
