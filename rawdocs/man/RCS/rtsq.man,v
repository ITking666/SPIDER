PURPOSE:  Rotates, scales, and shifts image circularly.
          (Circularly means image is assumed to be periodic). 
          Rotates counter-clockwise around the image center
          (NX/2 + 1, NY/2 + 1). (Negative angles = clockwise.
          Output image has '<b>'SAME'</b>' size as input image.
          Order: Scales, rotates, shifts.

          [Enter the register positions in the document file where these
          parameters are found. If scale register is zero the scale defaults
          to 1.0. Note that the first two columns in a document file are
          '<b>'NOT'</b>' not called registers so the 3'rd column is the
          first register. ]
        
         .ANGLE/SCALE/SHIFT DOCUMENT FILE: ANGDOC
          [Name of document file that contains angle in degrees, 
          scale factor (>0), X, and Y shifts.

         .OUTPUT STACK FILE: STACK03@@
          [Enter the name of the file where the centerd
          images are to be placed.  This output file will be a 
          whole stack. Image numbers within the stack will 
          correspond to the input stack] 

       Different prompt variations occur for other possible combinations 
       of input and output file stacks.


NOTES: 1. The operation is done using a single interpolation
          of the input image; thus, there is no problem of accumulation of 
          interpolation errors.

       2. A change of scale does not change the image dimensions.
          All the parameters agree with the output of the
          marker program (operation '<a href='"'mk.html'"'>''MK''</a>').

       3. The input file may be three-dimensional.  In this case, 
          each of the slices is separately rotated and shifted with
          respect to the z-axis, and stored in the output file, which 
          will be created with the same dimensions.

       4. Shifts can be any real numbers.

       5. The accuracy of interpolation is higher than that of the
          bilinear interpolation used in the 
          '<a href='"'rt.html'"'>''RT''</a>' operation, but it is 
          much lower than the accuracy of Fourier based bicubic spline 
          used in:  
          '<a href='"'rtsf.html'"'>''RT SF''</a>'.  The speed, however,
           about 2.5 times faster than  'RT SF' interpolation.

       6. Since interpolation is used, it is possible for
          the output image min. & max. intensities to be outside the 
          range of the input image.

       7. Implemented by: P. Penczek.
