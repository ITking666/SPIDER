VO MQ     Vector Operation - create selection files from 'AP' output  VO MQ
                                                               12/30/04

PURPOSE:  Create a set of selection document files from the output
	  document file of the 'AP REF' or 'AP SH' operations.  When
	  the correlation coefficient (CCC) between an image and the
	  most similar reference image exceeds given threshold, the
	  experimental image is listed in a selection document
	  file which is specific for that reference image.  Thus the
	  selection document files show how the experimental images are
	  partitioned among the reference files.  In addition a
	  reference summary output file is created which contains the
	  how many images assigned are to each reference.

           [Enter the correlation coefficient threshold.  The
           correlation coefficient describes the relative similiarity of
           the particle to the reference projection. Particles with the
           correlation coefficient value below the specified threshold
           will be excluded from the output selection document files.
           Enter 0 for the correlation coefficient threshold to include
           all particles.]

           the specific reference.
           E.g. in selection doc file: sel005 
           the first reference column in the doc file will contain a 
           list of the experimental
           images that were assigned to reference number five.
           The second register column contains those images's
           correlation coefficients, and the third column contains a flag
           indicating whether a mirrored reference image was used.]
