@AP SA     Alignment - reference free, Shift ||                  AP SA    
                                                                3/21/12

PURPOSE:  Reference free shift alignment of an image series.
          This operation together with operation 'AP RA' (rotational alignment)
          constitutes a reference-free approach to alignment of
          2D images.  A detailed description of the method can
          be found in "Three-dimensional reconstruction of single
          particles embedded in ice". P.Penczek et al., Ultramicroscopy,
          40 (1992) 33-53.  An example of the SPIDER procedure
          implementing the alignment is included below.

           number coming from 'AP C'.]

          .CHECK 180 DEGREE ROTATION? (Y/N): N
          [Answer 'Y' should be given only if the images to be processed
           were on previous step aligned by 'AP RA' or 'AP C 'with option
           Half ring, which means that auto-correlation functions were aligned.
           Answer 'N' speeds up of this operation.]

          .ALIGNMENT DOCUMENT FILE: aligndoc
          [This is one of the the two outputs produced by this procedure.
           It contains 6 columns:

           '</table>'

           The rotation angle is obtained from the input document file and 180 degrees is added
           if found to be needed by this operation.]

          .OUTPUT AVERAGE FILE: avg_img_001
          [Average image as found by the procedure.]


NOTE:  1. The less surrounding noise is included
          the faster operation runs and results are better.

       2. Note that shift parameters produced by this operation                
          are given with the proper signs. To  shift the images
          afterwards these parameters should be applied directly (without
          sign reversion). To combine parameters given by repeated
          alignment 'SA P' operation has to be used. The angle signs used
          for 3-D reconstruction from tilted series have to be reversed.

       3. Implemented by Paul Penczek.

;  b02.sup  -  ALIGNMENT  01/09/98
;  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

;  Important notes:

;  (1) To start the procedure one has to modify the input file names
;  and specify input parameters: number of steps required, number
;  of particles and ring numbers used by APRA (determined by the
;  expected radius of the particle).

;  (2) The shift alignment step does not enforce centering of the average
;  by itself.  The average produced by AP SA (AVS*** in the following
;  procedure) has to be centered explicitly.  In the procedure operation
;  CG PH (phase approximation of the center of gravity) is use for
;  this purpose.  It is not guaranteed to work for all the possible
;  shapes and it is advisable to verify whether the average was
;  shifted correctly.  If not, the operation can be easily replaced
;  by the other mean of centration (for example croscorrelation
;  with low-pass filtered disk).

;  (3) Please note that CG PH will NOT work correctly for images
;  with inverted contrast (dark particle on bright background).
;  In such case either contrast of the particles has to be inverted,
;  or the contrast of the average before application of CG PH.

;  (4) VERY IMPORTANT:  if you want to start the procedure again
;  from the beginning you have to either delete previously produced
;  document files or change the names of the existing file.

;  (5) The procedure can be easily restarted to make additional steps
;  of alignment. If initially procedure was ran for 5 steps of alignment
;  than it is enough to change register X61 in the input block
;  to the new iterations limit, remove part of the procedure between "End
;  of the input parameters" block to the main do-loop LB9 and change
;  in this line "2" to "6" (in this case, in general to the next step
;  number).

;  (6) The procedure makes it possible to calculate the current resolution
;  of 2D average. The code has to be added by the user in the place marked.

; %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

;  DESCRIPTION OF THE FILE NAMES USED:

;  The input data is the series of images
;  data/PAR****    1-1210

;  The output data is the separate series of images calculated after
;  each step of alignment
;  ali/PUR*****
;  first digit stands for the number of alignment step, the remaining
;  four digits are reserved for the particle number.
;
;  Program uses the following document files:
;
;  FALS - dummy file to initialize first shift alignment containing
;         particle numbers
;
;  APSA*** - ending with the number indicating the number of alignment
;            step. This is the document file produced by the shift
;            alignment (AP SA). Details are in the manual chapter APSA.MAN.
;
;  APRA*** - ending with the number indicating the number of alignment
;            step. This is the document file produced by the rotational
;            alignment (AP RA). Details are in the manual chapter APRA.MAN.
;
;  PRM***  - ending with the number indicating the number of alignment
;            step. This is the document file containing the combined alignment
;            parameters for each particle after all alignment steps made
;            up to this one. When applied to the initial (input) data
;            they will produce the aligned and centered series of particles.
;            The angles (after reversing the sing) can be used in 3D
;            reconstruction.
;            This file contains four columns:
;              1                      2        3        4
;            particle number        angle    X shift   Y shift
;
;  SHIFTS -  contains X,Y shifts needed to center the average calculated
;            after each shift alignment.

;  The procedure requires specification of the following input: 
;  X61 - number of alignment steps 
;        First is the initialization step - shift only (APSA)
;        Next X61-1 double steps are made - (rotation + shift)

;  X62 - number of particles
;  X63 - first particle number
;  X41 - first ring number (required by AP RA)
;  X42 - last ring number (required by AP RA)

           AP SR  (shift $ rotational alignment)
a42 9
          .X,Y order of splines: 4,4
          [Order of splines used during rotation of input images.
           Must be at least 2. Higher then 6 can produce "overshoot" errors.
           The time of running the whole program strongly depends on given
           spline orders (linearly).
           If the answer 0,0 is given the quadratic interpolation will be
           used in the program. It is considerably faster than b-spline
           interpolation and the accuracy is sufficient.]

       3. B-spline interpolation is supplied only on systems
          containing IMSL library.

       4. The command is used by the refal.sys procedure.
