AD R      Add two images with ratio                          AD R     
                                                           3/24/03

PURPOSE:  Adds the value in the first image times a factor to
          the ratio of the first image to the second image times
          a factor i.e. P3 = P1 * factor1 + (P1 / P2) * factor2. 
          The sum is placed in an output file.            '<br />'
          '<b>'Legacy operation replaced by 
          '<a href='"'addr.html'"'>''ADD R''</a>''</b>'

          AR    

USAGE:    AD R

          .INPUT  FILE: PIC001
          [Enter the name of the first file to be added.  (Header
           positions from this file are transferred to output.)]

          .NEXT INPUT FILE: PIC002
          [Enter the name of the next file to be added. Can be
           same as first input file.]

          .FACTORS FOR FIRST & SECOND FILES: 2, 7
          [Factors.]

          .OUTPUT FILE: PIC999
          [Enter the name of the output file.  Can be same as 
           either input file]

NOTES: 1.  Only works for files with the same dimensions. 

       2.  Does not work for Fourier files.
