          measures of proximity between two volumes.
          Calculates the differential phase residual over a shell with 
          of specified ring width and the Fourier shell correlation between 
          shells of the specified widths and stores the values in a document 
          file.  Takes real or Fourier input volumes.

          3. References                                                              '<br />'

          4. Scale search is done separately for each shell. This will NOT lead 
             to sensible results if one of the transforms falls off rapidly in a 
             frequency range where the other transform is strong.  The range specified 
             by the user is divided into 20 steps and searched for the lowest
             value The value:                                             '<br />'
             R(McPherson) = 2*SUM(ABS(F1)-ABS(F2))/SUM(ABS(F1)+ABS(F2))   '<br />'
             is calculated at each step within a shell and its minimum is used to 
             determine the correct scale factor for the second Fourier transform. 

          5. The 'NO SOLUTION' warning message relates to DPR normalization 
             factor between two volumes, which is searched using a brute 
             force method.  This message is '<b>'NOT'</b>' relevant to FSC results.

	  6. The "LACKS MAXIMUM" warning pertains to the DPR only.  If
	     you do not use DPR, you can ignore it.                   '<br />'

	     If you use DPR, you should be aware that DPR, unlike FSC,
	     depends on the relative multiplicative scaling of two
	     Fourier transforms .  Simply speaking, FSC is a correlation
	     coefficient, so it does not depend of either F or G being
	     multiplied by anything.  At the same time, DPR contains sums
	     of |F| and |G|, so the result will depend on 'S', as in
	     |F|+S|G|.  Thus, the proper definition of DPR should state
	     that it is a minimum over 'S', the fact rarely brought up. The
	     range of S has to be specified by the user and one is
	     prompted for it.  If there is no minimum within the range
	     specified, the warning will appear.  If the two structures
	     compared originated from the same data set, the minimum
	     should be found somewhere between 0.2, 2.  If it does not, it
	     is likely that one of the structures is wrong.  If, on the
	     other hand, 'RF 3' is used to calculate cross-resolution,
	     i.e., to compare EM and X structures, the warning will
	     almost always appear, as two structures are usually in
	     completely different scales.


         7.  A correlation coefficient 'R' implies a SNR=2*R/(1-R). (Factor
             2 comes from the fact that for the purpose of comparison the whole data set is 
             divided into halves). SNR=4.0 implies R=0.67 SNR=2.0 implies R=0.5 Why 
             these two special cases of SNR? According to Unser FSC=0.67 should 
             correspond to DPH=45.

PURPOSE:   Calculate the differential 3-D phase residual and the Fourier Shell 
           Correlation between two 3-D volumes. The Differential Phase 
           Residual over a shell with thickness given by shell
           width and the Fourier Shell Correlation between shells of specified 
           widths are computed and stored in the document file. Does not need 
           powers of two dimensions (for exclusions see 'FT MR' operation) and 
           needs REAL input images.  NSAM, NROW and NSLICE need to be equal.

PURPOSE:   Calculate the differential 3-D phase residual between two 3-D
           volumes. 
           The average phase residual over a shell with thickness
           given by ring width is computed and stored in the document file.

           missing cone (around Z* axis; cone angle theta1).  The 3-D 
           regions for which the phase residual is computed are toruses 
           with given diameter D centered on the Z* axis.  The torus is 
           defined by the inclination angle (0 corresponding to Z*=0 
           plane) and by the distance R from the origin.
              For a given inclination angle, a set of non-overlapping 
           toruses with different distances R from the origin are 
           defined, and the corresponding torus-averaged phase residual 
           is stored in a document file. In addition, the averaged 
           phase residual over a shell with thickness d is computed 
           and stored in the document file.
