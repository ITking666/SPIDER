PJ SHAD   Projected Surface - cosine Shading                    PJ SHAD 
                                                                 09/09/96

PURPOSE:  Apply shading to a surface representation.  Intensity of
          each facet is equal to the cosine of the inclination.

SEE ALSO: PJ ST     
          PJ COL      
 
USAGE:    PJ SHAD

          .INPUT FILE: SUR001
          [Enter file containing the surface representation created
          with 'PJ ST'.]

          .OUTPUT FILE: SUR002
          [Enter file that will contain the shaded surface  
          representation]

          .INTERPOLATION FACTOR: 1
          [If the surface representation was interpolated to a
          larger size, enter the factor by which the image was  
          interpolated.  Internally, the values contained in the input
          file are multiplied by this factor.]

          .ILLUMIN. ANGLE, INTENSITY: 45, 0.5
          [added the seceond light with 45 degree and 0.5 intensity]

          .MIX FACTOR: 0.6
          [A part of the surface representation's Z-buffer is added
          to the image containing only the cosine shading. If
          A1, A2, A3 are the three points of the facet used to  
          calculate the inclination, the mixing is calculated using
          the formula:                                            '<br />'
                 F=COS-MIX*(A1+A2+A3)/(3*(FMAX-FMIN))+MIX         '<br />'
          with F being the resulting value, COS the cosine of the 
          inclination, MIX the Mix Factor, and FMAX and FMIN the 
          maximum and minimum of the surface representation image 
          (Z-buffer).]
