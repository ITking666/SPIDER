DOC AND   "And" two Document files                                DOC AND
                                                                5/9/05

PURPOSE:  "And" two document files.  The output file contains
          all input lines which occur in both input files.  All 
          values are converted to integers so this operation is 
          only useful for columns containing integer values!

SEE ALSO:  DOC CREATE    
           DOC MERGE     
           DOC MIRROR     
           DOC SUBTRACT  
 	      
USAGE:    DOC AND

          .INPUT DOCUMENT FILE: DOC001
          [Enter name of first input document file.]
 
          .SECOND INPUT DOCUMENT FILE: DOC002
          [Enter name of second input document file.]
 
          .OUTPUT DOCUMENT FILE: DOC002
          [Enter name of output document file.]

          .COLUMN TO BE CHECKED (0 IS KEY): 1
          [Enter column number which will be ANDed. If the
          key column (0) is chosen the new document file will contain
          those keys found in both input files. All other columns
          will contain the contents of the other columns in the 
          first file.    
          If a column other than the key column is specified then the 
          new file will have original keys in the key column.
          If the same value is found in the specified column of both 
          input files then that line from first file is placed in
          the output file.]

NOTES:    The sort routine sometimes fails on large files which
          are already perfectly sorted.
