TF CT     Generate Transfer Function - Complex, phase flipping, binary   TF CT
                                                             5/29/13

PURPOSE:  Generate the phase
          '<a href='"'../techs/ctf/ctf.html'"'>'contrast transfer function'</a>' for
	  bright-field electron microscopy. This operation produces a 
          binary or two-valued
	  (-1,1) transfer function in complex form. This function can be
	  applied, using the 'MU' or 'TF CTS' operation, to the Fourier
	  transform of an object for correcting of the phase of
          bright-field weak phase contrast. For literature, see Notes.

USAGE:    TF CT

          .OUTPUT FILE: TFC001
          [Enter name of file that will store the computed function. 
           The transfer function is computed in complex form compatible 
           with the Fourier transform format.]

          [Enter the 
           '<a href='"'../glossary.html#Spherical'"'>'spherical aberration coefficient'</a>'

          [Enter the amount of '<a href='"'../glossary.html#Defocus'"'>'defocus'</a>,
          in Angstroms.  Positive values correspond to underfocus (the preferred region);
          negative values correspond to overfocus. Next, enter
          the wavelength of the electrons.  The value used in
          this example corresponds to 100kV. 
          A table of values is listed in the glossary under 
          '<a href='"'../glossary.html#Lambda'"'>'lambda'</a>'.]

          .NUMBER OF SPATIAL FREQ. POINTS: 128
          [Enter the dimension of the 2D array.  In our example,
          each element of the array (K,I) corresponds to a spatial
          frequency                                                     '<br />'

                  Ky = (I-65) * DK                                      '<br />'
          where DK is defined by the next input.]

          [Enter the 
           '<a href='"'../glossary.html#Spatial'"'>'spatial frequency'</a>'
          radius corresponding to the
          maximum radius ( = 128/2 in our example) of pixels in the
          array.  From this value, the spatial frequency increment
          (DK=0.15/64) is calculated.]

          .SOURCE SIZE [A-1], DEFOCUS SPREAD [A]: 0.005,250
          [Enter the 
          '<a href='"'../glossary.html#Sourcesize'"'>'size of the illumination source'</a>'
          in reciprocal Angstroms.  This is the size of the source as it appears in
          the back focal plane of the objective lens.  A small value
          results in high coherence; a large value, low coherence.
          Enter the estimated magnitude of the defocus 
          '<a href='"'../glossary.html#Defocusspread'"'>'variations'</a>'
          corresponding to energy spread and lens current fluctuations.]

          [Enter the defocus variation due to axial 
          '<a href='"'../glossary.html#Astigmatism'"'>'astigmatism'</a>'.
          The value given indicates a defocus range of +/- 400 A around
          the nominal value as the azimuth is changed. Then, enter the 
          angle, in degrees, that characterizes the direction of 
          astigmatism.  The angle defines the origin direction in which 
          the astigmatism has no effect.]

          .AMPLITUDE RATIO CONTRAST [0-1]: 0.2
          [Enter the '<a href='"'../glossary.html#ACR'"'>'ACR'</a>' 
          See below for definition.]

          .SIGN (+1 or -1): -1
          [Application of the transfer function results in contrast
          reversal if underfocus (DZ positive) is used.  To compensate for 
          this reversal, use sign switch -1.)
         
          The transfer function is then computed in complex form compatible 
          with the Fourier transform format.

NOTES: 1. Theory and all definitions of electron optical parameters
          are according to:                                           '<br />'

          functions for partially coherent illumination. Optik, 38(5), 519-536.'<br />'
          and                                                         '<br />'

          Internally, the program uses the generalized coordinates defined in 
          these papers.

       2. In addition, an optional cosine term has been added with a weight.
          The complete expression is:                          '<br />'
          TF(K) = [(1-ACR)*sin(GAMMA) - ACR*cos(GAMMA)]*ENV(K)]

       3. To apply the transfer function to a model 2D structure, use the following steps:       '<br />'
            (i)   Use 'FT' to compute the Fourier transform of the model structure,              '<br />'
            (ii)  Use 'TF C' to compute the transfer function in complex format,                 '<br />'
            (iii) Use 'MU' to multiply the Fourier transform with the complex transfer function, '<br />'
            (iv)  Use 'FT' to compute the inverse Fourier transform.

PURPOSE:  To compute the phase contrast transfer function for
          bright-field electron microscopy.     
          The "TF CT" option produces a trinary (-1,0,1) T.F. in complex form
	  so that it can be applied (by using "MU") to the Fourier transform
          of an object for correcting the phase of EM bright field weak
          phase contrast. Literature, see Notes.
