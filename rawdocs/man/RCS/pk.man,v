PURPOSE:  Searches for local peaks in an image.
          This operation '<b>'does NOT find'</b>' "maximum" location when image
          has plateaus.  It may even find the "last" value along the
          plateau.  To overcome this use low pass filtration first
          or use 'PK M'.

          position other than at the image's center (NX/2 + 1,

      If the option "CENTER ORIGIN OVERRIDE" is specified, SPIDER asks the next two questions:

          is printed out and listed in the document file along
          with the other parameters of the peaks.]
          '</div>'

NOTES:    1.  In the above example, the computer will find the 12
          largest peaks.  These positions will be printed in the
          RESULTS file labeled as follows:

          '<table border="0" cellpadding="2">'
          '<th>''<td>'NO'</td>'   '<td>'IX'</td>'  '<td>'IY'</td>'  '<td>'XO'</td>' '<td>'YO'</td>' '<td>'HEIGHT'</td>'  '<td>'RATIO'</td>' '</th>'
          '</table>'

          '<table border="0" cellpadding="1">'
          '<tr>''<td>'NO'</td>'      '<td>'Peak number                                       '</td>' '</tr>'
          '<tr>''<td>'IX'</td>'      '<td>'Integer X peak location relative to image         '</td>' '</tr>' 
          '<tr>''<td>'IY'</td>'      '<td>'Integer Y peak location relative to image         '</td>' '</tr>'
          '<tr>''<td>'XO'</td>'      '<td>'Integer X peak location relative to origin        '</td>' '</tr>'
          '<tr>''<td>'YO'</td>'      '<td>'Integer Y peak location relative to origin        '</td>' '</tr>'

          '<tr>''<td>'RATIO '</td>'  '<td>'Peak height relative to highest or specified peak '</td>' '</tr>'
          '</table>'

          The sub-pixel offset of a parabolically fitted peak and height of the peak will also
          be printed in the results file.

          2. Maxima occuring on the boundary of the image are '<b>'IGNORED'</b>'.

          3. The register variables from the command line (if any)
          can be used as input to a subsequent 'SH' (SHIFT) operation.

          the coordinates and the value of the largest peak found

          of the first peak relative to the peak # specified for 
          that ratio (option ORIGIN OVERRIDE). The last two registers
