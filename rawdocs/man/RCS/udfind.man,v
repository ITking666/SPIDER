UD FIND   Unsave Document - Find value                        UD FIND   
                                                            11/18/09

PURPOSE:  Given a specific register column and a desired value
          retrieves first line from a document file having the desired
          value in the specified register column.  Document files are 
          stored in-core after first use until they are cleared with 
          'UD FIND E'.

SEE ALSO: UD FIND E
          UD NEXT  
          UD IC     

USAGE:    UD FIND [key],[r1],[r2],....                       

          [Where: <key> returns the document file key and [r1],[r2],........ 
           returns up to 100 registers from that line.  If the 
           requested value is not found the [key] will contain a zero.]
            
          .DOCUMENT FILE: DOC998                                    
          [Enter name of the document file.]        '<br />'         

          .REGISTER COLUMN & VALUE WANTED:  3, 102                                    
          [Enter register column to be searched and search value.] '<br />'         

          [For example with the following document file: '<br />'  
 '<pre>' 
 ; dat/dat   16-Sep-96  AT 09:52:24   doc007.dat                                                                      
       1 2  22.000      142.00    
       2 2  101.00      202.00    
       3 2  102.00      303.33    
      11 2  111.00      712.00    
     100 2  112.00      613.00 
 '</pre>' 

  '<br />'
          The following SPIDER procedure: '<br />'    

 '<pre>' 
      UD FIND [key],[r1],[r2]
      doc002
      1,102

      VM
      echo ' ' r1: {****[r1]}    r2: {%f8.2%[r2]}
 '</pre>' 
    
          Will give the following output:
 '<pre>' 
           R1: 102    R2:   303.00
 '</pre>' 

NOTES: 1. When the end of the file is reached without finding the desired
          value the returned 'key' value is zero.
 
       2. IMPORTANT: only 12  document files may be 
          accessed concurrently with 'UD IC' or 'UD FIND'.  Once the limit is
          reached one of the current files must be       
          cleared by a 'UD ICE' or 'UD FIND E'  command.  An attempt
          to apply 'UD FIND' to a 13'th document file before execution
          of a 'UD FIND E ' command to free the area reserved for data from
          an existing file will result in an error message.]
