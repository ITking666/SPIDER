TF DDF      Transfer Function - Determine Defocus & amplitude contrast   TF DDF    
					                     11/11/14

PURPOSE:   Calculate the defocus and amplitude contrast ratio from minima 
           of 1D profile of contrast transfer function. Input can be single 
           image or a series of images.  This operation has not been used
           in almost 20 years and may not function properly.

SEE ALSO: TF      
          TF C     
          TF C3    
          TF CT    
          TF CT3   
          TF CTS   
          TF D     
          TF DEV   
          TF DNS
          PW   

USAGE:    TF DDF

          .NUMBER OF IMAGES IN THE SERIES: 1
          [Enter number of images. If you want to process a series images, 
          number input images in either increasing or decreasing sequence.]

          .IMAGE FILE: ro008
          [Enter file name of 1D half-profile of power spectrum.]

          .MAX SPATIAL FREQUENCY [A-1]:  0.171
          [Enter the 
           '<a href='"'../glossary.html#Spatial'"'>'spatial frequency'</a>'
          radius corresponding to the maximum radius of pixels in the array.]

          .SEARCH NEIGHBORHOOD DISTANCE: 5
          [This parameter controls the size of the local neighborhood that is 
          searched for local minima. For each point in the spectrum, N points
          on either side are searched (total neighborhood = 2N + 1 pixels).]

       At this point, minima are located and printed out. The first column contains 
       the keys, the second column is the location of each minimum (value is interpolated
       between pixels), the third column has the same location in spatial frequency
       units. The last column represents the amplitude of the minimum. e.g.:
       '<pre>'
        CURVE HAS: 8  MINIMA:
        #     RADIUS   RADIUS (FREQ)   AMPLITUDE
             (PIXELS)    (A-1)
        1   42.00    0.0164           0.0732
        2  175.84    0.0687           0.0300
        3  249.61    0.0975           0.0251
        4  303.99    0.1187           0.3888
        5  349.06    0.1364           0.2255
        6  395.03    0.1543           0.0160
        7  430.32    0.1681           0.4989
        8  467.99    0.1828           0.1609
        '</pre>'

          .CHANGE SEARCH NEIGHBORHOOD? (Y/N): No
          [ If "Y", the above operation will be repeated. Smaller search areas may
          identify noise as minima, resulting in spurious minima. Large search areas
          can smooth out and overlook actual minima if they are too small. Increase
          the search neighborhood if your data is very noisy; decrease it if you have
          many small minima.]

          .NUMBER OF MINIMA USED FOR CTF?: 3
          [Enter the number of minima you want to include in the calculation.]

          POINT # 1
          .SPATIAL FREQ. POINTS & ABERRATION (PI): 28.0, -1
          [Enter the grid point of the minimum, which is found in the second 
          column in the list of minima found by the program, and its 
          corresponding aberration value in units of pi. For underfocus, the
          first minimum is -1, the second is -2, the next is -3, and so on.
          For overfocus, the first minimum is zero, the second is 1, the next
          is 2, and so on.]

          POINT # 2
          .SPATIAL FREQ. POINTS & ABERRATION (PI): 58.8, -2

          POINT # 3
          .SPATIAL FREQ. POINTS & ABERRATION (PI): 83.1, -3

       If a defocus series is used, SPIDER asks:
         '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'		
          .CONSTRAINTS: (1), (2) or (3): 1
          [Enter the choice of constraints, as follows:                  '<br />'
          (1) Same amplitude,                                      '<br />'
          (2) Same amplitude and define defocus interval,          '<br />'
          (3) Same defocus.                                        '<br />'
           ]
          '</div>'

          .LAMBDA (ANGSTROMS): 0.037
          [Enter the wavelength of the electrons.  The value used in
          this example corresponds to 100kV. A table of values is listed 
          in the '<a href='"'../glossary.html#Lambda'"'>'glossary'</a>'.]

          .SPHERICAL ABERRATION CS [MM]: 2.0
          [Enter the spherical aberration coefficient, in mm.]

      At this point, values are calculated and printed out:
         '<pre>'
          DEFOCUS = 24278.6875 (Angstroms)
          AMPLITUDE CONTRAST =  0.143490 
         '</pre>'

          .DO YOU WANT TO GENERATE A FILTER? (Y/N)  : y
          [This option can generate a 1D filter file which is used by 
          'FD' to correct the CTF.]

      If you answer "Y", SPIDER asks:

         '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'          .OUTPUT FILE: fil008
          [Enter the name for the filter file. The filter files are 
          generated in the same sequence as the input files if you 
          process a series.]
          '</div>'


NOTES: 1. The outline of the theory is as for TF. See Zhu et al. (1997)
          '<i>' Journal of Structural Biology'</i>', 118, 197-219.

       2. The amplitude contrast ratio is calculated by a grid search method, 
          and low spatial frequency minima are treated with a special weighting 
          for amplitude contrast.

       3. The method to prepare a 1D profile is described in J. Zhu and J.
          Frank (1994) In, '<i>'Electron Microscopy 1994 (Proceedings of the 13th
          Intl. Congr. on Electr. Microsc. (Paris))'</i>', pp.465-6. The procedure 
          for calculating power spectrum is given below:
