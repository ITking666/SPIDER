IQ GONE   Wait until a file is gone                          IQ GONE 
                                                             8/8/08

PURPOSE:  To wait until a file does not exist.  A primitive method of
          synchronizing different SPIDER runs.

SEE ALSO: IQ SYNC

USAGE:    IQ GONE [wait_time] '<br>'

          .WAIT FOR DISAPPEARANCE OF FILE: PIC001
          [Enter name of file which you want to wait for.  The file may be a non-SPIDER file,
          a SPIDER image file, an image in a SPIDER image stack,
          an inline SPIDER "file", an image in an inline SPIDER
          image stack "file", or any other file.  If the file  
          exists, the system will query existence until it
          disappears or till the maximum wait time has been exceeded.  

         .DELAY INTERVAL AND MAXIMUM WAIT: 1,360000
         [Specify the seconds for delay between queries and the 
         maximum overall wait time.  The default values are 1 second 
         delay between queries for a maximum wait of 9999999 seconds.

NOTES:   1. Optional register receives the total wait time.
