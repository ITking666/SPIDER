@TF ED	Transfer Function - Estimate Defocus from image power spectrum    TF ED
                                                                       03/05/13

PURPOSE: Estimates the 
         '<a href='"'../glossary.html#Defocus'"'>'defocus'</a>', 
         and cutoff frequency of high frequencies based on 2-D power
         spectrum. Outputs defocus to operation line register.
         This operation is normally used on square 'tiles' windowed from 
         a larger original micrograph; e.g. use the procedure: 
         '<a href='"'../techs/recon/newprogs/powdefocus.spi'"'>'powdefocus.spi'</a>'
         The astigmatism calculation was '<b>'UNRELIABLE'</b>' and has been removed.

         '<a href='"'../glossary.html#Spherical'"'>'spherical aberration coefficient'</a>'

         (as a fraction).  For ice images this may be about 0.1, 
         for negative stain about 0.15.  Default value is 0.1.]
			
	.OUTPUT DOCUMENT FILE: CTF001
         [Enter name for document file which will contain 4 register 
          columns of noise information (NOT defocus values).]

NOTES	1. The output document file contains following four register columns: '<br />'
           a) - Spatial freqency (1/A).                              '<br />'
           b) - Estimated background noise: BACKGROUND_NOISE(f)**2.  '<br />'
           c) - Background-subtracted power spectrum:  
              {CTF(f)*ENV(f)*SIGNAL(f)}**2=PW(f)-BACKGROUND_NOISE(f)**2 '<br />'
     	   d) - Estimated ENV(f)**2                                     '<br />'
			
   	2. The power spectrum model is:
    	   PW(f) = {CTF(f)*ENV(f)*SIGNAL(f)}**2+ BACKGROUND_NOISE(f)**2
		
   	3. For details about this algorithm and cutoff frequency see:
           Z. Huang, P.R. Baldwin, and P. A. Penczek.   Automated
           determination of parameters describing power spectra of 
           micrograph images in electron microscopy. 
           J. Struct. Biology  144, 2003, 79-94 

        4. Implemented by: Zhong Huang. 

        5. If the operation is unable to determine the parameters due to
           a abnormal power spectrum SPIDER will not stop in procedural mode.
           The output file will contain zeros for all values.  This allows
           processing a large set of images efficiently.

        6. For calculating agstigmatism use the SPIDER operation 
           '<a href='"'ctffind.html'"'>''CTF FIND''</a>'
           which outputs the angle and magnitude of astigmatism as 
           determined by:
           '<a href='"'http://emlab.rose2.brandeis.edu/software'"'>'CTFFIND3'</a>'

         X16 is the cutoff frequency in 1/A]
