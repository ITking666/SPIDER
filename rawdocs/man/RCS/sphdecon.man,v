SPH DECON  Spherically deconvolute a volume       SPH DECON
                                                    5/21/14

PURPOSE:  Increase resolution of a reconstructed volume using
          spherical deconvolution. Output volume has same 
          size as input volume.                           '<br>'
          In a reference-based single particle reconstruction an 
          angular assignment is used to determine a projection 
          direction for particle images with the best match to 
          reference projection. Noise and low contrast in electron 
          micrographs leads to uncertainty in angular assignment and  
	  blurring of the resulting 3D reconstruction. Spherical 
          deconvolution improves reconstruction quality by reducing 
          blurring and enhancing high frequency components, 
          especially near the periphery of the reconstructed object.
          Note that this method does not increase resolution as
          reported by Fourier ring correlation of sub-set volumes,
          however actual resolution is improved.

USAGE:    SPH DECON

          .INPUT FILE: VOL001
          [Enter name of  of file containing input volume.]

          .SIGMA: 30
          [Enter the deconvolution angle in degrees. See notes.]

          .OUTPUT FILE: DECVOL001
          [Enter name of file where the deconvolved volume is to
          be stored.]


NOTES: 1. Determine the optimal value of deconvolution angle: 
          '<i>'SIGMA'</i>', 
	  by examining deconvolutions with different  values of '<i>'SIGMA'</i>'.
	  The optimal '<i>'SIGMA'</i>' corresponds to deconvolved volume with
	  the highest high-frequency component in the spacial spectrum. The
	  average amplitude in the 3D Fourier transform spectrum can be
	  calculated using the SPIDER operations:
          '<a href='"'pw.html'"'>''PW''</a>' and
          '<a href='"'rosd.html'"'>''RO SD''</a>'.
