CE RIDGE  Contrast Enhancement - Ridge Following           CE RIDGE 
                                                            5/08/01

PURPOSE:  Creates ridge image/volume.  Useful for texture
          based segmentation. 

SEE ALSO: CE RAN
          ER SK

USAGE:    CE RIDGE

          .INPUT FILE: VOL001
          [Enter the name of the input file.]

          .OUTPUT FILE: VOL002
          [Enter  name for output file.]
        
NOTES: 1.  Image/volume is "circularly closed" so that pixels on 
           boundaries have a neighbor on opposite boundary.

       2.  The current pixel is set to the image mimimum
           whenever its value is less than all immediate neighbors or
           whenever the immediate neighbors have a maximum that is
           greater than the current pixels value. The neighborhood is 
           3x3.
