PURPOSE:  To read register variable(s) into register variable(s).
	  This operation is only useful within a procedure where it
	  copies registers from a calling procedure into the current
	  procedure.

USAGE:    RR G[var1],[var2],[var3],...

          .VALUE(S): [var1],[var2],[var3]
          [Enter the existing register variables from a higher level
          procedure which are to be copied into the current
          register variables: [var1],[var2],[var3]. The variable
          names in the current procedure do not have to be the same.
