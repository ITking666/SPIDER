RT        RoTate - image or volume, use average as background, bilinear interpolation      RT
                                                               1/02/02

PURPOSE:  Rotates an image or slices from a volume counter-clockwise 
          around the center (NX/2 + 1, NY/2 + 1).
          Negative angles are  rotated clockwise. 
            The background rotated into the image field is 
          the average of the input image 
          '<br>' '<b>' OBSOLETE! USE 'ROT' INSTEAD!'</b>'

SEE ALSO: ROT   
          RT 90  
          RT SQ   
          RT SF   

USAGE:    RT

          .INPUT FILE: PIC001
          [Enter the name of the file to be rotated.]

          .OUTPUT FILE:  IMG044
          [Enter the name of the file where the rotated image is to
          be kept.]

          .ROTATION ANGLE: 90.0
          [Enter the rotation angle in degrees. PIC001 will then be rotated 
          90 degrees, and the rotated image put in IMG044.]

NOTES: 1.  The input file may be three-dimensional.  In this
          case, each of the slices is separately rotated around
          the z-axis, and stored in the output file which will
          be created with the same dimensions.

PURPOSE:  Rotates a picture counter-clockwise around the center

          Note that the notions "clockwise" and "counter-clockwise"
          refer to the mirrored x-y system used for image display.

NOTES: 1. The rotation angle can be specified by reference to a
          register:  '-X10' will input the rotation angle (with
          inverted sign) found in a previous 'OR X10' operation.
          Whether or not the sign has to be inverted follows
          from the order of argument files in 'OR'.
