RT 3A    RoTate - volume, arbitrary center, quadratic interpolation RT 3A
                                                            04/11/02

PURPOSE:  Rotates volume around an arbitrary center by three 
          Eulerian angles. Uses tri-quadratic interpolation.
          '<br>' '<b>' OBSOLETE! USE 'ROT A' INSTEAD!'</b>'

SEE ALSO: ROT A    
          RT 90 
          RT SQ 
          RT SF 

USAGE:    RT 3A 

          .INPUT FILE: PIC001
          [Enter name of the file to be rotated.]

          .OUTPUT FILE: ROT001
          [Enter name of the file where the rotated volume is to
          be stored.]

         .PHI, THETA, & PSI: 10.5, 13.7, 45.8
          [Enter the rotation angles Phi (around Z),  Theta (around Y),
           and Psi (around Z)]. 

          .X, Y, & Z CENTER OF ROTATION: 12, 27, 32
          [Enter x,y coordinates of center of rotation.  Volume
           extends in x from 1 to NX, in y from 1 to NY, and
           in z from 1 to NZ.]
 
NOTES: 1. Tri-quadratic interpolation scheme is used.

       2. First rotation is done around Z-axis (clockwise), second
          rotation is done around Y-axis (clockwise) and the 
          third rotation is done around Z-axis (clockwise). All rotations
	  are done in space coordinate system.

       3. Rotation matrix used:
          '<pre>'
          R = R(psi) * R(theta) * R(phi)

           c  s  0        c  0 -s      c  s  0
          -s  c  0    *   0  1  0   * -s  c  0
           0  0  1        s  0  c      0  0  1
          '</PRE>'

       4. In the corners, old values are left.

       5. Implemented by A. Leith.

NOTES: 1. Program reads input volume into the memory - larger volumes
          may not fit. In this case use 'RT 3' instead. Unfortunately 
          'RT 3' gives slightly incorrect results and does not use the 
          proper interpolation scheme and has sign of theta reversed.
