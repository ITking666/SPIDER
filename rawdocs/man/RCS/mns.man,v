MN S      Montage of images - with individual Scaling           MN S
                                                            2/25/12

PURPOSE:  Put images from a series into montage with individual scaling.

SEE ALSO: MN  

USAGE:    MN S

          .FILE PREFIX OR TEMPLATE (EG. PIC***): TER***
          [Enter file name template for the image series.]

          .FILE NUMBERS: 1-5,12-16,20-28,31-38
          [Enter numbers of files to be placed into montage.  All
           files must have same dimensions as the first file.]

          .NUMBER OF IMAGES PER ROW, MARGIN WIDTH: 5, 10
          [Enter number of images per row of the montage, and margin
          width between images and around outside.]

          .MARGIN VALUE: 0.5
          [Enter value to be put in margin areas and unused areas.]

          .OUTPUT FILE: MON001
          [Enter name of file to receive montage image.]

NOTES: 1. Each image is individually rescaled according to:  '<br />'
          '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp;  DNEW = (DOLD - FMIN) * 2./(FMAX - FMIN) '<br />'
          Consequently, the montage is scaled between 0.0 and  2.0.  
          Each image comes out with full contrast.

       2. This option should not be used if the individual images
          represent slices of a volume, since the inter-relation
          between the dynamic ranges of the different slices gets
          lost.
