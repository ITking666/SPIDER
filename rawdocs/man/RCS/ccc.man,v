CC C      Cross Correlation Coefficient                           CC C      
                                                               3/26/12

PURPOSE:  Computes the Pearson correlation coefficient and Euclidean distance
	  between two images/volumes by direct computation.
          The precise area to be compared is defined
          by a mask image/volume (elements > 0.5 define the pass region).
          The dimensions of the images/volumes  and the mask have to 
          be same. Optional register output can be requested.
          Works on images and volumes.

           '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp; Standard deviation of #1 under mask,      '<br />'

           '&'nbsp;'&'nbsp; Euclidean distance.]

NOTES:     1.  Correlation coefficient is in the range -1.0 ... 1.0

           2. The Pearson correlation coefficient based on a 
              sample of paired data (Ai, Bi):  '<br />''<br />'

          '<img  class="img_out" src="../exa/images/cc-1.jpg">' '<br />''<br />'

              An alternative formula for the Pearson 
              correlation coefficient with a convenient single-pass 
              algorithm was used in the code: '<br />''<br />'
