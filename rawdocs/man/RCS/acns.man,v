@AC NS     Self Correlation - Normalized ||                      AC NS

PURPOSE:  Computes the self-correlation function of an image/volume by
          using the Fourier transform relationship.   

SEE ALSO:  AC N    
           AC S

           CC

           CN      
           CN N   
           FT     

USAGE:    AC NS

          .INPUT FILE: PIC001
          [Enter the name of the image/volume to be self-correlated.]

          .OUTPUT FILE: ACF001
          [Enter name of the file which will contain the self-correlation
          coefficients.]

NOTES: 1. On completion of this operation, the output file will contain
          the self-correlation function.            '<br />'
          The origin is at
          (INT(NX/2) + 1, INT(NY/2) + 1, INT(NZ/2) + 1). '<br />'
          The SCF is not normalized.
          
       2. The type of input data can be either real or Fourier.

       3. The self-correlation function is defined in "Correlation functions
          revisited", M. van Heel, M. Schatz, E. Orlova. Ultramicroscopy, 46,
          (1992) 307-316; as inverse Fourier transform of the square root
          of the modulus of the Fourier transform of the input image.

          using the Fourier transform relationship.  The dimension
          of the picture need not be a power of two (see 'FT' for 
          restrictions).  Works for 2D and 3D.
