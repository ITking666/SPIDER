CL CLA    Classification - Automatic                       CL CLA   
                                                           11/30/11

PURPOSE:  To find clusters of images/elements in factor space 
          (or a selected subspace) by using Diday's method of 
          moving centers, and to apply hierarchical ascendant 
          classification (HAC) using Ward's method
          to the resulting cluster centers.  '<br />'
          Reads input from 'CA S' operation. '<br />' 
          Produces a Postscript dendrogram plot and a dendrogram 
          description doc. file.  These
          files can be used to determine the images/elements assigned
          to each cluster (class). '<br />'
          See: '<a href='"'../techs/classification/tutorial.html'"'>'Classification and Clustering Tutorial'</a>'

          Enter '*' to skip creating this file.]
          
NOTES:  1. The RESULTS file contains the following information: '<br />'

          A) Aggregation history:                               '<br />'
          For each of the NP partitions, the NS seeds and sizes of
          clusters are listed.  The non-empty clusters in the crossed  
          partition are given by size and cummulative percentage.  A 
          total of NS**NP clusters are possible, but in practice, only
          10% of these are non-empty.                           '<br />'

          B) Description of hierarchy nodes:                    '<br />'
          The nodes are numbered starting from the number of the highest
          cluster.  For each node, the Senior, Junior, size, weight
          and hierarchy index are given.  The hierarchy index is printed
          out as a histogram.                                   '<br />'

          C) Description of the classes:                        '<br />'
          For each node the constituent classes are listed.     '<br />'

          D) Dendrogram:                                        '<br />'
          The class relationships are represented in the form of a     
          dendrogram (tree structure).  The lengths of the branches (in
          horizontal print direction) are proportional to the heirarchy
          indices.                                             '<br />'

          E) List of class members:                                       '<br />'
          The members are listed for each of the basic non-empty classes. '<br />'

          F) List of class center coordinates:                            '<br />'
          For each class, the NFAC coordinates of its center is listed.
          These are contained in the cluster file.                        '<br />'

          G) Re-classification lookup table:                  '<br />'
          Each cutoff point in the dendrogram, from right to left, defines
          a new classification scheme with the number of classes increasing
          by 1 each time.  The table gives the new class memberships for
          any cutoff point selected.                          '<br />'

       3. The algorithm underlying this set of programs is described by
          Lebart et al., 
          '<i>'Multivariate Descriptive Statistical Analysis, '</i>'
          J. Wiley and Sons, New York 1984, Chapter V, p.109.
 
       4. To repeat a run and get the exact same results you must start with the
          same random number generator seed.  
          Use '<a href='"'./md.html'"'>''MD''</a>' 
          with option 'SET SEED' before invoking 'CA CLA'.

       5.  Every vertical line at the bottom of the dendrogram (with no cutoff)
           represents an image that you input into 'CA S'.  Each vertical line 
           is an average of the images, or vertical lines, below it.       '<br />'

	   The threshold is a scaled value from 0 to 100 that informs 'CL CLA'
           how far "up" the dendrogram you wish it to look. A
	   threshold set at the bottom would result in the number of classes
	   being equal to the number of input images. A median threshold value
	   of 50 results in fewer classes.  And a top level 
	   threshold gives a single class containing of all the inputs.

       6. With untruncated results and or very many classes the Postcript
          plot lines/labels may be overwritten, sorry.
