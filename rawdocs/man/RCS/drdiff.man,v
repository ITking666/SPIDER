@DR DIFF   Density Reference - Error & Difference between two volumes  DR DIFF
                                                                2/25/14

PURPOSE:  Calculates the mean relative error and the discrepancy
          between two volumes within an (optional) mask. A scaling 
          factor and additive constant is determined to scale the second 
          volume such that the errors are minimized. Optionally volume 1
          is subtracted from the scaled volume 2 and the results stored in
          an output volume. 
          '<b>'Operation includes all functions of obsolete legacy operation: 'DR ERR'. '</b>'
  
USAGE:    DR DIFF [f],[con],[dif],[dis]
          [This operation can return up to four optional register variables:
