MA SOFT   Mask - image/volume with a soft adaptive mask    MA SOFT     
                                                            4/25/13

PURPOSE:  Masks an image/volume with a mask at a specified threshold.
	  Pixels greater than the threshold retain their value and
          pixels lower than threshold have a soft Gaussian or cosine
          based falloff.  This is mainly useful with a threshold of 0.5
          to soften binary (0/1) masks.  If used on grey scale images
          its operation may not be intuitive.

SEE ALSO: MA  
          MM     
          MM C   
          TH F

USAGE:    MA SOFT [inside],[surface]
         [The first optional register variables will contain the number
          of pixels within the 100% area and the second will contain the
          number of pixels/voxels on the 100% surface.]

          .INPUT FILE NAME OR TEMPLATE: PIC001
          [Enter the name of the file to be masked.]

      If the input file name contains astericks for set of images, 
      SPIDER asks:

           '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .FILE NUMBERS OR SELECTION DOC. FILE NAME:   1-[num]
          '</div>'

          .OUTPUT FILE: PIC002
          [Enter the name of the output file.]

      If the input file name contains astericks for set of images, 
      SPIDER asks:

           '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .FILE NUMBERS OR SELECTION DOC. FILE NAME:   1-[num]
          '</div>'

          .GAUSSIAN or COSINE SOFTMASK (G/C): G
          [ Enter 'G' for a mask with no modification inside 
           the mask range, and Gaussian-shaped falloff 
           outside this range.                            '<br />'
           Enter 'C' for a mask with no modification inside 
           the mask range, and cosine-shaped falloff outside  
           this range.]

          .THRESHOLD LEVEL: 0.5
          [Enter the desired threshold at which masking occurs.]
          

    If 'G' was entered for Gaussian softmask, SPIDER asks:
          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .WIDTH: 3.0
          [Enter the falloff width.]
          '</div>'

    If 'C' was entered for Cosine softmask, SPIDER asks:
          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .HALFWIDTH: 3.0
          [Enter the falloff half-width.]
          '</div>'

NOTES:     1.  Not optimized for speed with volumes. 

           2. Can be used on grey-scale images with an appropriate
              threshold or with binary masks.
