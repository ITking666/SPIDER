TF C3     Transfer Function - Complex 3D                   TF C3
                                                           10/10/10

PURPOSE:  Generate the phase
          '<a href='"'../techs/ctf/ctf.html'"'>'contrast transfer function'</a>' for
	  bright-field electron microscopy. This operation produces a 
          the transfer function in complex 3D form.
          It can then be applied, by using 'MU' or 'TF CTS' , to the Fourier transform
          of a model object for simulations of bright-field weak
          phase contrast. For literature, see Notes.

USAGE:    TF C3

          .OUTPUT FILE: TFC001
          [Enter name of the output file that will store the computed function. 
           The transfer function is computed in complex 3D form compatible 
           with the Fourier transform format.]

          .CS [MM]: 2.0
          [Enter the '<a href='"'../glossary.html#Spherical'"'>'spherical aberration coefficient'</a>'.]

          .DEFOCUS [A], LAMBDA [A]: 2000, 0.037
          [Enter the amount of defocus, in Angstroms.  Positive 
          values correspond to underfocus (the preferred region);
          negative values correspond to overfocus. Next, enter
          the wavelength of the electrons.  The value used in
          this example corresponds to 100kV. 
          A table of values is listed in the glossary under 
          '<a href='"'../glossary.html#Lambda'"'>'lambda'</a>'.]

          .NUMBER OF SPATIAL FREQ. POINTS: 128
          [Enter the dimension of the 3D array. In this example,
          each element of the array (K,I) corresponds to a spatial
          frequency:  Kx = (K-65) * DK            '<br />'
          where DK is defined by the next input.]

          .MAXIMUM SPATIAL FREQUENCY [1/A]: 0.15
          [Enter the 
           '<a href='"'../glossary.html#Spatial'"'>'spatial frequency'</a>'
          corresponding to the
          maximum radius ( = 128/2 in our example) of pixels in the
          array.  From this value, the spatial frequency increment
          (DK=0.15/64) is calculated.]

          .SOURCE SIZE [A-1], DEFOCUS SPREAD [A]: 0.005,250
          [Enter the 
          '<a href='"'../glossary.html#Sourcesize'"'>'size of the illumination source'</a>'
          in reciprocal Angstroms.  This is the size of the source as it appears in
          the back focal plane of the objective lens.  A small value
          results in high coherence; a large value, low coherence.
          Enter the estimated magnitude of the 
          '<a href='"'../glossary.html#Defocusspread'"'>'defocus variations'</a>'
          corresponding to energy spread and lens current fluctuations.]
   
          .ASTIGMATISM [A], AZIMUTH [DEG]: 400, 30
          [Enter the defocus variation due to axial 
          '<a href='"'../glossary.html#Astigmatism'"'>'astigmatism'</a>'.
          The value given indicates a defocus range of +/- 400 A around
          the nominal value as the azimuth is changed. Then, enter the 
          angle, in degrees, that characterizes the direction of 
          astigmatism.  The angle defines the origin direction in which 
          the astigmatism has no effect.]

          [Enter the '<a href='"'../glossary.html#ACR'"'>'ACR'</a>' and the
                     '<a href='"'../glossary.html#GEH'"'>'GEH'</a>'. 
          The Gaussian envelope parameter specifies
          the 2 sigma level of the Gaussian (see note 2 for details).]

          .SIGN [+1 or -1]: -1
          [Application of the transfer function results in contrast
          reversal if underfocus (DZ positive) is used.  To compensate for this
          reversal and make the modified structure displayable by surface
          representation, use the sign switch -1 above.]
          
NOTES: 1. Theory and all definitions of electron optical parameters
          are according to:                                           '<br />'
          Frank, J. (1973). The envelope of electron microscopic transfer
          functions for partially coherent illumination. Optik, 38(5), 519-536.'<br />'
          and                                                         '<br />'
          Wade, R. H., & Frank, J. (1977). Electron microscope transfer
          functions for partially coherent axial illumination and chromatic
          defocus spread. Optik, 49(2), 81-92.                        '<br />'
          Internally, the program uses the generalized coordinates defined in 
          these papers.

       2. In addition, an optional cosine term has been added with a weight,
          and an ad hoc Gaussian falloff function has been added as discussed
          in Stewart et al., '<i>'EMBO J'</i>'. 12 (1993) 2589-2599.  '<br />'

          The complete expression is:                                  '<br />'

          TF(K) = [(1-ACR)*sin(GAMMA) - ACR*cos(GAMMA)]*ENV(K)*exp[-(K/GEH)^2] '<br />'
          In an array of size N, with halfsize H = (N/2)+1. Each 
          element of the array (K) corresponds to a spatial
          frequency:                                                  '<br />'
          Kx = (K-H) * DK                                             '<br />'
          where DK is the maximum spatial frequency.]

       3. To apply the transfer function to a model structure, 
          use 'TF CTS' operation.

       4. This operation can produce volume of any dimensions (need not be
          power-of-two); consult 'FT MR' manual chapter for the 
          exclusions. Volume size must be the same in all 3 dimensions.
