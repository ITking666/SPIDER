PURPOSE:  Retrieve particular values from file header by location in the
          file header and place the values in specified register variables. '<br />'   

          '<b>'Note: This is a legacy operation.  It has is usually easier to use:

SEE ALSO: FI H   
          FI A  
          FI N

      If register variables are present on the operation line then SPIDER asks:

          The routine allows the user to retrieve  particular locations
          from the file label and place them in the desired registers.

          NOTE: label location input through subroutine GETNUM.

NOTES: 1. In procedures, 'FI' may be used to introduce the first
          three letters of a filename, later to be completed by an
          appropriate filename construction.  This has been retained
          from the old 6-letter filname convention.  The use of this
          method is no longer recommended!

            EXAMPLE:
                FI
                ?FILE NAME?
                DO LB1, I=1,10
                MO
                <1>00I
                .
                .
                .
                LB1

          In this particular application, 'FI' will not set the
          error flag in a batch run; i.e., if no file is found by
          'FI', this will not cause an error exit in a batch run.

       2. The label records of the file contains the following buffer
          positions which can be retrieved (among others).

                   7  FMAX  = IMAGE MAXIMUM
                   8  FMIN  = IMAGE MINIMUM
                   9  AVD   = IMAGE AVERAGE
                  10  SIG   = STANDARD DEVIATION (SQ. ROOT OF VARIANCE)
                  11  IHIST = FLAG INDICATING THAT HISTOGRAM HAS
                              BEEN COMPUTED, AND STORED
                  14  IANGLE= FLAG INDICATING THAT TILT ANGLES STORED
                  15  PHI   = TILT ANGLE
