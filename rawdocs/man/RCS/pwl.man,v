PW L      Power spectrum - Log10                              PW L
                                                            9/26/06

PURPOSE:  Generates full, unscrambled 0.5 * logarithm of the power spectrum
          from complex Fourier transform for 2-D or 3-D images.
          Reads either the real image/volume or its Fourier transform.
          The resulting data are real and can be displayed like
          a normal image.  Note that the output can contain 
          negative values.


SEE ALSO: PW   
          FT

USAGE:    PW L

          .INPUT FILE: FOU001
          [Enter  name of the image/volume. Can be the real image/volume
           or its Fourier transform.]

          .OUTPUT FILE: POW001
          [Enter the name of the file where  
           0.5*LOG10(power spectrum) is to be placed.]

NOTES: 1. The center of 2-D power spectrum is placed in
          (NX/2+1, NY/2+1);

       2. The center of 3-D power spectrum is placed in
          (NX/2+1, NY/2+1, NZ/2+1).

       3. The term |F(0)| is replaced by term |F(1)| to facilitate
          visualization.

          The input 2D image can be real if it fits into the memory.
          Operations supports multiple radix FFT, thus the input
          image does not have to have power-of-two dimensions

          the Fourier matrix, i.e., the Fourier transform of a 63x105

          For the 3D case the output file contains the power spectrum 
          in the proper format (not transposed).

       2. The term corresponding to F(0,0) or f(0,0,0) is removed
          to avoid problems with the display. The center of the 2D power 
          spectrum is placed in (NSAM/2+1,NROW/2+1); for the 3D case
