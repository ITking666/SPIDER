UD        Unsave Document                                      UD      
                                                         05/10/13

PURPOSE:  Unsaves a set of registers from a document file. If there 
          are multiple lines with the same key unsaves the last such
          line.

SEE ALSO: UD E    
          UD N     
          UD S    
          UD IC    

USAGE:    UD [k], [val1],[val2],[val3]
            '&'nbsp; <or>                '<br />'
          UD 15, [val]                   '<br />'
            '&'nbsp; <or>                '<br />'
          UD -1,[valc]
         
          .DOCUMENT FILE: DOC001
          [Enter the name of the file where the registers are to be
          found. The first variable after 'UD' is used as a key
          for retrieving the desired register set stored in the
          document file.  In the above example, let us assume [k] 
          has the value: 4.  The document file is searched 
          for the last
          (or, in the case of 'UD S', next) entry under this key
          number.  If this entry consisted of the line:      '<br />'
                  4  3  -1.5   30.8   0.0                    '<br />'
          then the values -1.5, 30.8, and 0.0 are put into the
          register variables [val1],[val2],[val3], respectively.] '<br />'
 '                                                                '<br />'
          If more register variables are specified on the operation
          line than exist in the document file line, an error
          message is printed out.  In the above example, '<br />'
                 UD [k],[val1],[val2],[val3],[val4]      '<br />'
          would produce an error statement because the number of
          registers exceeds the three registers present for that key.]

NOTES: 1. Sequential search 'UD S' is much faster than non-sequential, and
          should be used whenever it is certain that no updates have
          occurred.

       2. If the specified key is -999 < key < 0 then the operation 
          searches the document file for a line preceeded by a 
          semicolon similar to a comment.  This line is treated as
          as a regular line containing a special key and list of 
          registers.  This allows the retrieval of a limited set of 
          values like rotation angles which are somehow associated 
          with all the contents of the document file.  The normal retrieval 
          process (positive keys) treats these lines like comments.

       3. The document file is left open until closed with 'UD E' or
          until another document file is used with 'UD'.  This saves
          time when there are multiple accesses.
