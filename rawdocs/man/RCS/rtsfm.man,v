RT SF M   Rotate, Shift & Mirror - image, Fourier based spline interpolation || RT SF M
                                                              03/30/12

PURPOSE:  Rotates, scales, and shifts image circularly.
          (Circularly means image is assumed to be periodic). 
          Rotates counter-clockwise around the center
          (NX/2 + 1, NY/2 + 1). (Negative angles = clockwise.
          Output image has '<b>'SAME'</b>' size as input image. 
          Order: Scales, rotates, shifts, and mirrors.

USAGE:    RT SF M

          .INPUT FILE NAME OR TEMPLATE (E.G. STK@@****): instack03@@
          [Enter template for the names of the file(s) to be rotated.  
           This template can alternatively refer  
           to a single image (e.g. img001), or  
           to a series of single images (e.g. img***),    
           to a series of stacked images (e.g stack3@@***), or
           to a whole stack of images ending in '@@' (e.g. stk@@).    
           Templates containing an asterisk will have the astericks substituted 
           with a number for the file.]

     If there is only a single input file specified the following 
     final four prompts appear:
          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
         .OUTPUT FILE: rot001
          [Enter the name of the file for the rotated and shifted
          image.]

          .ROTATION ANGLE, SCALE, MIRROR (IF < 0): 90, 1, 0
          [Enter the rotation angle in degrees, scale factor, and 
           mirror request.
           Default scale is set to 1.0 (see Note 2). 
           Default is unmirrored]

          .SHIFTS IN X & Y: 12.34, -1.98
          [Enter the X and Y shift values in pixels.]
          '</div>'

      Otherwise if the input file name contains astericks for
      a set of images the following prompts appear:
          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'

         .FILE NUMBERS OR SELECTION DOC. FILE NAME: select_03 
          [Enter the file numbers to be substituted into the file name 
          template or name of a selection document file that contains 
          the file numbers in the first register.]

         .REG. #'S FOR ANGLE, SCALE, X & Y SHIFT, AND MIRROR (OR * FOR: 6,0,7,8,15): (6,0,7,8,15) 
          [Enter the register positions in the document file where these
          parameters are found. If scale register is zero the scale defaults
          to 1.0. Note that the first two columns in a document file are
          '<b>'NOT'</b>' not called registers so the 3'rd column is the
          first register. ]
        
         .ANGLE/SCALE DOCUMENT FILE: ANGDOC
          [Name of document file that contains angle in degrees, 
          scale factor (>0), X, and Y shifts.

         .OUTPUT IMAGE FILE NAME OR TEMPLATE (E.G. STK@@****)',
          [Enter template for the names of the output image files. 
           The rotated and shifted images are placed in these files.
           This template can alternatively refer  
           to a series of single images (e.g. img***), or   
           to a series of stacked images (e.g stack3@@***), or
           to a whole stack of images ending in '@@' (e.g. stk@@).    
           Templates containing an asterisk will have the astericks substituted 
           with a number for the file.]
          '</div>'

      Otherwise if the input file is a whole stack the following 
      prompts appear:

          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'

         .REG. #'S FOR ANGLE, SCALE, X & Y SHIFT, AND MIRROR (OR * FOR: 6,0,7,8,15): (6,0,7,8,15) 
          [Enter the register positions in the document file where these
          parameters are found. If scale register is zero the scale defaults
          to 1.0. Note that the first two columns in a document file are
          '<b>'NOT'</b>' not called registers so the 3'rd column is the
          first register. ]
        
         .ANGLE/SCALE DOCUMENT FILE: ANGDOC
          [Name of document file that contains angle in degrees, 
          scale factor (>0), X, and Y shifts.

         .OUTPUT IMAGE FILE NAME OR TEMPLATE (E.G. STK@@****)',
          [Enter template for the names of the output image files. 
           The rotated and shifted images are placed in these files.
           This template can alternatively refer  
           to a series of single images (e.g. img***), or   
           to a series of stacked images (e.g stack3@@***), or
           to a whole stack of images ending in '@@' (e.g. stk@@).    
           Templates containing an asterisk will have the astericks substituted 
           with a number for the file.]
          '</div>'

       Different prompt variations occur for other possible combinations 
       of input and output file stacks.

NOTES: 1. Operation is done using a single interpolation of the input image.
          Thus, there is no accumulation of interpolation errors.

       2. A change of scale will not change the image dimensions.

       3. The input file may be three-dimensional.  In this case, 
          each of the slices is separately rotated and shifted with
          respect to the z-axis, and stored in the output file, which 
          will be created with the same X, Y & Z dimensions.

       4. Shifts can be any real numbers.

       5. The accuracy of Fourier based bicubic spline (FBS) interpolation 
          is much superior to the quadratic interpolation used in the 
          '<a href='"'rtsq.html'"'>''RT SQ''</a>' operation. 

       6. It is possible for the output image min. & max. intensities to 
          be outside the range of the input image.

       7. Implemented by: G. Kishchenko.
