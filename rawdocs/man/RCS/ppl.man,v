PP L      Put Points in image - from Document file Listing       PP L
                                                         07/07/97

PURPOSE:  Reads locations from a document file and places a pixel 
          into the specified image or volume file at that location.  
          The pixel value (intensity) can be read from the document 
          file or set to a solicited value.
          '<b>' The input file will be overwritten!'</b>' 

SEE ALSO: PP P  
          PP LL  

USAGE:    PP L

          .INPUT FILE: CCF001
          [Enter the name of the existing image file to be marked]

          .DOCUMENT FILE: DOC001
          [Enter name of document file where values to be interpreted
          as coordinates are located.]

       If the input file is a 3-D volume SPIDER asks:
         '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .X-COL, Y-COL, Z-COL: 1, 2, 3
          '</div>'

       If the input file is an image SPIDER asks:
          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
         .X-COL, Y-COL: 1, 3
          '</div>'

          [Enter the register columns of the document file where the values
          are stored that are to be interpreted as X, Y, & Z coordinates,
          respectively.  Note that a 0 specification for X-COL will
          cause the doc file keys to be used as x-positions. ]

          .INTENSITY COL. (& INTENSITY IF NOT IN COL. OF DOC FILE): 4
          [Enter the register column of the document file where the values
          of the point intensity are stored.  If zero is entered,
          then the the intensity for points is set to the second input.]

       If the input file is a 3-D volume SPIDER asks:
         '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .X-FACTOR, Y-FACTOR, Z-FACTOR: 1, 1, 1
          '</div>'

       If the input file is an image SPIDER asks:
         '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .X-FACTOR, Y-FACTOR: 1, 1
          '</div>'

          [Enter scaling factors to be applied in X, Y & Z directions.
          If the output dimensions specified are equal to the
          dimensions of the file where the coordinates originated,
          X-FACTOR=1, Y-FACTOR=1 & Z-FACTOR=1 would be the common 
          specification.   A minus sign for the second scale factor 
          inverts the y-direction so that a plot with conventional 
          axes directions  is obtained.]

       If the input file is a volume SPIDER askss:
          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .X-OFFSET, Y-OFFSET, Z-OFFSET: 0, 0, 0
          '</div>'

       If the input file is an image SPIDER asks:
          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .X-OFFSET, Y-OFFSET: 0, 20
          '</div>'

          [Enter offset (after scaling) for X, Y & Z values.  
           X-OFFSET=0, Y-OFFSET=0 & Z-OFFSET=0 are common inputs where 
           doc. file coordinates correspond to image file size.]

          .KEYS TO BE USED:  1-25,28
          [Enter the keys of the document records you wish to use.

NOTES:    1.  FMIN and FMAX are correct upon leaving this routine, however,
          AVD and SIG are not. 

          2.  Following is an example for the use of 'PP L' to plot a
          histogram of a set of values (e.g., correlation peak values)
          stored in a specified column of a document file:

          Let's assume the peak values have been stored by a previous
          operation in column 4 of document file DOC001.  The file
          contains 150 entries stored under keys 1-150, all of which
          should be used in the plot.  The peak values are relative to
          the value of the first (highest) peak; i.e., their value
          range is 0 to 1.

          First, the image into which the plot is to be inserted
          must be created, e.g. by operation 'BL'.
          In our example, the x-dimension of the image representing 
          the plot should be chosen as 150 (corresponding to
          one pixel per data point).  The y-dimension can be chosen
          arbitrarily, its choice is governed only by aesthetic and
          layout considerations.  Let's say 50 has been chosen.  The
          correct command sequence for drawing a histogram is:

          '<PRE>'
