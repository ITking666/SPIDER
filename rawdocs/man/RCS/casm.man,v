PURPOSE:  Print selected factor map and eigenvalues.             '<br />'
          See: '<a href='"'../techs/classification/tutorial.html'"'>'
          Classification and Clustering Tutorial'</a>' for further info.

          CA SRI   
          CA VIS
          CL CLA
    
USAGE:    CA SM

          .IMAGE OR PIXEL COORDINATES (I/M): I
          [Enter 'I' if you wish to have a map of images, and 'P'
           for a map of pixels.]

          .COORDINATE FILE PREFIX: coran_may
          [Enter the prefix identifying the data files created
           from a previous '<a href='"'./cas.html'"'>''CA S'</a>'' 
           run: _IMC, _PIX, & _EIG.  
           Do not include trailing underscore.]

          .NO. OF HORIZONTAL PATCHES: 0
          [The number of horizontal patches does not need to be 
           specified, UNLESS this particular CORAN analysis
           was done on a set of correlation patch averages.  In this
           case, a small lookup map is printed on the sheet
           preceding the actual map, which helps you trace the image
           numbers back to the patches they originated from in the 
           image field.  E.g., a set of 18 patch averages originating 
           from 3 rows of 6 patches each would require the input: 
           NO. OF HOR. PATCHES = 6, and this would yield the lookup map: '<br>'

           '<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="4">'
           '<tr align="right">''<td>' 1  '</td>' '<td>' 2  '</td>''<td>' 3  '</td>''<td>' 4  '</td>''<td>' 5  '</td>''<td>' 6  '</td>' '</tr>'

           '</table>'

          .TWO FACTOR NUMBERS FOR MAP (E.G: 1,5): 1,2
          [Enter the number identifying the factors for which the map
          is to be printed.  Factor 1 is the first non-trivial factor.]

          .SYMBOL, ASSIGN SYMBOL, CLASS, DOC, ID (S/A/C/D/J/I): I

          [Enter 'S' if you want to enter a character symbol for
                     each active image;                           '<br />'
           Enter 'I' if you want the numbers identifying the images
                     or pixels to be printed. (this is the standard 
                     option for a CORAN map.);                   '<br />'

           [The following additional options are for images only:'<br />'
           Enter 'A' if you want to assign symbols to specific 
                     ranges of ID numbers.                       '<br />'
           Enter 'C' if you want the class number of the image to
                     appear as symbol (in this case, a cluster file
                     from a previous run of 
                     '<a href='"'./cacla.html'"'>''CL CLA'</a>' 
                      must be available).                         '<br />'
           Enter 'D' if you want to supply a specific symbol for each
                     image. (in this case, a document file must be supplied
                     that specifies the symbol lookup)].

    If 'S', SPIDER will ask:
          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .1 CHAR. SYMBOL FOR ACTIVE IMAGE/PIXEL: #
          '</div>'
    For all options, SPIDER will ask:

          .PREPARE POSTSCRIPT FILE FOR MAP? (Y/N): Y
          [Option 'Y' prepares Postscript output containing the map.
           Option 'N' lists map in RESULTS file only.]
 
       If the answer is "N" SPIDER will ask: 
          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .NUMBER OF PAGES (1,2,3) OR <CR>=1: 2
          [Specify number of pages for the map.]

          .NUMBER OF LINES OR <CR> FOR DEFAULT: <CR>
          [Default:  horizontal space, known from the number of
          pages, is used to determine the number of lines.  Enter a
          number if you want to override the default.]
          '</div>'

       For all answers, SPIDER will ask the following two questions:

          .NUMBER OF SD OR <CR>=2.3: <CR>
          [The map is truncated for efficient visualization of the
          data cloud.  Normal cutoff is set at 2.3 x standard
          deviation.  Outliers outside the map are listed along with
          their coordinates, and printed exactly on the border.]

          .1=FLIP #1/ 2=FLIP #2/ 3=FLIP 1+2/ <CR>=NO FLIP:<CR> 
          [Flips axis of map.]
          '</div>'

      In case the 'C' option was selected SPIDER will ask:
          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .CLUSTER FILE: CLU002
          [Enter the name of the cluster file  from a previous run of 
                     '<a href='"'./cacla.html'"'>''CL CLA'</a>'
          '</div>'
.
      In case the 'A' option was selected, SPIDER will ask:
          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .SYMBOL: X
          [Enter symbol]
          .Until ID #: 320
          [Enter upper limit up to which the symbol should be used]
          .SYMBOL: y
              .
          .Until ID #: 320
              .
          [The questions continue until 0 or <RETURN> is entered for
           ID #.]
          '</div>'

    In case the 'D' option was selected, SPIDER will ask for name 
    of document file containing the symbol lookup:
          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .LOOKUP FILE: DOC001
          [the document file should contain, the
          original image ID number (=Key), and the standard
          Fortran code number of the ASCII character to be used
          as symbol (=Register 1)].
          '</div>'

      If a Postscript map was requested SPIDER will ask following
      questions. Usually the default <CR> answer is OK unless
      you want 'pretty' axes or labels:
          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .POSTSCRIPT OUTPUT FILE: posmap
          [Default extension is .ps.]

          .TEXT SIZE FOR AXIS AND DATA (USE <CR> FOR DEFAULT = 10): 12, 12
          [Allows control over text size.  A size of 10 is a reasonable
          default. A negative answer will skip the following questions
          and use appropriate default values instead.]

          .X AXIS OFFSET: 0

          Bounds for X axis of plot listed.

          .NEW LOWER, UPPER AXIS BOUNDS OR <CR>: <CR>
          [Can change y axis bounds or keep default by entering <CR>.]

          X axis label units listed.

          .NEW AXIS LABEL UNIT AND TICKS / LABEL OR <CR>: <CR>
          [Can change X axis label unit or keep default]

          .LABEL NO. TO EDIT. USE 0 FOR LABEL: 1
          -1 TO RELIST ALL LABELS, OR <CR> TO CONTINUE: <CR>

          Bounds for Y axis of plot listed.

          .NEW LOWER, UPPER AXIS BOUNDS OR <CR>: <CR>

          .Y AXIS OFFSET: 0 

           Y axis label units listed.

          .NEW AXIS LABEL UNIT AND TICKS / LABEL OR <CR>: <CR>

          .LABEL NO. TO EDIT. USE 0 FOR LABEL: 1
          -1 TO RELIST ALL LABELS, OR <CR> TO CONTINUE: <CR>
          '</div>'

NOTES:  1. A list of eigenvalues, their percentages, and cumulative 
           percentages will be written in the SPIDER results file.  

        2. See: 
           '<a href='"'../techs/classification/index.html'"'>'Classification and Clustering Summary'</a>' and
