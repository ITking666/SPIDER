@SP        Find info on diffraction pattern spots                SP
                                                               9/25/06
           
PURPOSE:  Finds the intensities at all the points of a lattice or at
          a single point or finds the center and radius of a ring,
          e.g. of spots from a powder diffraction pattern.

USAGE:	  SP

          .OPTION  L/S/R:
          [Enter 
          'L' to find the lattice parameters and the intensities
             of all the spots in a lattice,               '<br />'
          'S' to find the intensities of one or more spots 
             one-at-a-time, or                            '<br />'
          'R' to find the radius and center of a ring, e.g. for 
             a powder pattern.                             '<br />'
          Entering a character other than 'L', 'S' or 'R' ends the operation.]

          .SIZE FACTOR:  4
          [Enter the reduction factor used to create the reflection
          document file in WEB (see Note 2).  Entering a value of
          0 ends the operation.]
    
          .INPUT: LAT001
          [Enter the name of the image file with the spots to be
          measured.]

          .REFLECTION LIST:  WIN001
          [Enter the name of a document file to be used for selecting the
          spot(s) to be measured.]

          .FIRST KEY FOR REFL LIST (0 TO RETURN):  3
          [Enter the key corresponding to the index of the first spot you
          want to measure--it is helpful to have a printed output of the
          window file.]

          .MODE: MAX(1)/CNTR OF DEN(2)//NO BK CORR(-):  2
          [Choose the method used to determine the intensities.  Either the 
          position of the maximum value or the center of gravity within the 
          window is used to calculate the subsequent window positions.  If 
          MODE > 0,  a linear background subtraction is performed before 
          the calculations; if MODE < 0, no background is subtracted.]

          .WINDOW SIZE(ODD #):  25,35
          [Enter two numbers (odd works best, but is not necessary) for the
          size of the window you wish to use.    If the second number is 0, 
          it is reset equal to the first, i.e. a square window.  The intensity 
          is calculated for the mode and window size chosen; then you are 
          prompted for a new window size. To find the intensity of another 
          reflection, enter '0' as the first number.]

          NEXT KEY FOR REFL LIST (0 TO RETURN):  5
          [Enter the next key number.  Continue in this fashion until you
          have measured all the spots you want at each of the window sizes
          you want; then enter '0' to return.]

          .SIZE FACTOR:  4
          [Enter the reduction factor used to create the reflection
          document file in WEB (see Note 2).  Entering a value of
          '0' ends the operation.]
    
          .INPUT:  LAT001
          [Enter the name of the image file with the spots to be
          measured.]
          
          .DO YOU WANT A WINDOW POSITION DOCUMENT? (Y/N): Y
          [If you want to examine windows around one or more of the
          measured spots, enter 'Y'.  If you will want to use the
          'S' option to measure the intensities of individual spots,
          enter 'Y'.]

          .DO YOU WANT A PATTERSON FUNCTION DOCUMENT? (Y/N): Y
          [If you want to list the intensities for H and K less than
          or equal to 16, answer 'Y'.  A procedure has been written to
          produce a 33-by-33 image from such a document.  The 
          operation 'PW' can then be used to produce a Patterson function.]

          .WINDOW SIZE:  41,41
          [Enter NX,NY for the width and height of windows within
          which the intensities will be measured.  If one number is
          entered, the window will be NX by NY.  If no numbers are
          entered, or if the first number entered is 0, you are returned
          to ".OPERATION:".]

          .MODE: MAX(1)/CNTR OF DEN(2)//NO BK CORR(-):  2
          [Choose the method used to determine the lattice vectors and
          the intensities.  Either the position of the maximum value or
          the center of gravity within the window is used to calculate
          the lattice parameters.  If MODE > 0, a linear background
          subtraction is performed before the calculations; if MODE < 0,
          no background is subtracted.]
          
          .REFLECTION DOC.:  RFL001
          [Enter the name of the document file in which you have stored
          the indices and positions of three reflections to be used to
          calculate the lattice parameters.]
                    
          .MAX RADIUS,MIN RADIUS:  1500,50
          [Enter the largest distance from the lattice center to which
          you want to extend the measurement and the closest such distance.
          If the first value entered is less than the second, the
          message 'MAX RADIUS LESS THAN MIN RADIUS; TRY AGAIN!' appears,
          and you must re-enter the two values.]

          .REFLN. INDEX FOR REL. INT.:  8,4
          [Enter the H- and K-indices of a spot which will be divided into
          the measured intensities to give relative values.]

          .DOCUMENT FILE:  WIN001
          [If you answered Y to the window position query, enter the name
          of the document file in which you want to store the information
          about the positions and sizes of the windows used to determine the
          lattice and measure the intensities.  At the conclusion of the
          operation, the total number of window positions listed will be
          put into register X34.]

          .DOCUMENT FILE:  PAT001
          [If you answered 'Y' to the Patterson function document query, enter
          the name of the document file in which you want to store the 
          intensity data for producing the image for which PW will give the
          Patterson function.]

          .NUMBER OF SPOTS (3<M<21):  5
          [Enter the number of spots to be used in calculating the center and
          radius of the ring.]

          SPOT DOCUMENT:  RFL001
          [Enter the name of the document file in which you have stored
          the indices and positions of reflections to be used to calculate
          the center and radius of the ring.  This document file must be
          in the same format as that produced by the REFLECTION command
          in the program WEB: a heading record and three records with
          the key (integer), 5, key (floating), H-index, K-index, SAM 
          position, ROW position (all floating).]

          This option makes one calculation and then exits the operation.

NOTES:   1. The reflection and spot document files must be in the same format
          as that produced by the REFLECTION command in the program WEB:
          a heading record and three records with the key (integer), 5, key
          (floating), H-index, K-index, X-position, Y-position (all
          floating).

        2.  The reflection list format must be the same as that of the
          window document produced by the 'L' option: a heading record
          and document records with a key (integer), 6, H-index, K-index,
          X-position, Y-position and NX and NY window sizes (all
          floating).  N.b. the window positions are the upper left 
          coordinates of a window centered on the H,K spot.
          
        3.  The reflection list document file is searched sequentially,
          so you will encounter an error if the keys are not entered 
          in ascending order.  
          
         4. If fewer than three spots are to be used in option 'R', you are
          returned to ".OPERATION:"; if there are three spots, the appropriate
          equations are solved exactly; if there are more than three and
          fewer than twenty spots, a circle is least-squares-fitted to the
          coordinates of the spots; and if there are more than twenty spots,
          only the first twenty are used.          
     
        5. This operation has not been used here in years. If you have problems please 
           contact us.
