TT        Set image Title                                     TT      
                                                            6/04/99

PURPOSE:  Set image title, or overwrites the existing title.

SEE ALSO: TT COP  

USAGE:    TT

          .INPUT FILE:  PIC001 
          [Enter the filename.]

          .NEW TITLE:   RESULTS OF LAST RUN
          [Enter the new title you want to give the image. The
           title of the image will now be "RESULTS OF LAST RUN".]

NOTES: 1. "TT" is useful for making notes about a image, so
          that they are visible when the image is used.  
          However, they have no effect on the data, and the titles
          exist only for the user's convenience.

       2. The title is usually transferred to derivative files.   
          Otherwise, to transfer a title use  
          '<a href='"'ttcop.html'"'>''TT COP''</a>'.

       3. Long ago, the title used to be entered on the file name 
          line. This no longer works since it interfers with 
          file name substitution (June 97) and is not
          consistent with other operations in SPIDER.

       2. Be aware of the fact that the title is kept when the
          file is subjected to various operations.  For example,
          if file: PIC001 with title: RESULTS OF LAST RUN is 
          subsequently windowed to WIN001, the same title will 
          remain with WIN001  which can be misleading.  
          To delete a title, use 'TT' as above.

          However for new long label format files use 'ST' instead!!

       4. To put angles into title of short label images specify the
          registers containing the angles after the "TT" operation.
          For example:  "TT X10,X11".
