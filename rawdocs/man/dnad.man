PURPOSE:  Denoise an image or volume using anisotropic diffusion.

USAGE:    DN AD

          .INPUT FILE: VOL001
          [Enter name of the input file.]

          .OUTPUT FILE: VOL002
          [Enter name for output file.]
       
          .CPF, MCD, OR HEG?: CPF
          [Currently there are three different implementations: '<br />'
           CPF is Estes 'Corner preserving' formulation.        '<br />'
           MCD is Estes 'Mean curvature diffusion' formulation. '<br />'
           HEG is Frangakis & Hegerl's formulation.             '<br />'

          .ITERATIONS: 9
          [Number of iterations.]


       If 'MCD' is chosen the following question appears.

          '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
          .WEIGHTING FACTOR: 1.0
          [Weighting factor.]
          '</div>'

       If 'HEG' is chosen the following two questions appear.

         '<div class='"'opt_inp'"'>'
         .TIME STEP(0...0.25): .1

         .SIGMA & LAMBDA: 1.0 1.0
         [Sigma is standard deviation for Gaussian smoothing.
          Lambda is a contrast parameter.]
          '</div>'

NOTES: 1.  In option 'CPF' image/volume has 2 pixel 
           boundary set to zero.  The input data is automatically
           normalized over 0...1.0 before application of the
           algorithm.  Finally the original image range is
           recreated.  This option works in 2D, slice-by-slice on 
           a volume.

       2.  In option 'MCD' image/volume has a 1 pixel 
           boundary set to zero.  The input data is automatically
           normalized over 0...1.0 before application of the
           algorithm.  Finally the original image range is
           recreated.  This option works in 2D, slice-by-slice on 
           a volume.

       3.  Options 'CPF' & 'MCD' implement Adel's algorithm.
