AP SHC    Alignment - multi-reference, fast exhaustive rotation & shift ||*   AP SHC
                                                                      1/09/13

PURPOSE:  Determines optimal shifts and rotations to align a series of 
          experimental images with a series of reference images.  
          For each experimental image, it finds the in-plane Euler
          rotation angle, and X, Y translational shifts which align the image 
          with the most-similar reference image.  
          Exhaustively checks all requested rotations and shifts. 
          Can restrict angular range of projections and inplane rotation range.  
          Can restrict checking of mirror image.                        '<br />'

          This is a faster version of: 'AP SH' which can request rotation/shift
          alignment and denoising of the experimental images.           '<br />' 
                           
          (See '<a href='"'../align_overview.html'"'>'align_overview.html'</a>' 
           for comparison of 'AP' operations.)

         .TEMPLATE FOR REFERENCE IMAGES: REF@***
          [Give the template for the name of the existing file series of 2D 
           reference images (typically projections).]

         .FILE NUMBERS OR SELECTION DOC. FILE NAME: SELECTREF
          [Enter numbers of reference files. The file numbers can also
           be read from a selection document file where file numbers 
           are contained in the first register (not the keys).]

	 .TRANSLATION SEARCH RANGE IN X, IN Y (OPTIONAL), STEP SIZE': 6,2 
         [The search for translation parameters will be restricted to
           +/- search range, performed every "step size" pixel. '<br />'
           Restrictions:                                        '<br />'
           1. Search range + last ring <= NX/2-2                '<br />' 
           2. Search range has to be divisible by step size.]   '<br />'
           A search range of zero is allowed.                  '<br />'
           Speed will depend on square of the number of positions searched.   
           Use of 'step size' greater than one can speed up alignment 
           determination with little effect on final reconstruction resolution.  
          '<small>'For legacy compatibility the input value for Y shift is
          optional, if only two input values  are present the second value is
          interpreted as the step size.'</small>']

         .FIRST, LAST RING, RING STEP, & RAY STEP: 5,15,1,1
          [The search for rotational alignment will be restricted to
          pixels  with radii in the specified range (here: 5-15), performed 
          every 'ring step' radius and on every 'ray step' radial ray.  '<br />'
          Restrictions on 'ray' search, every: 1,2,4,8,16 'th radial
          ray can be included in search.                                '<br />'
          Use of 'ring step' and 'ray step' greater than one can speed up
          alignment determination on large images with minimal effect on
          final reconstruction resolution.                  '<br />' 

          '<small>'If you also wish to restrict the inplane rotation
          range, this prompt can accept two additional unsolicited reponses for
          the restricted range.  These are the starting and ending inplane
          rotations in degrees (from 0...360).  E.g. to search a 30 degree
          range around zero degrees specify: ,330,30.  Note that the
          outputs may slightly exceed the specified limits due to limited
          angular search resolution. '</small>']
               
         .OPTIONAL REFERENCE IMAGES ANGLES DOCUMENT FILE: Refangles
          [Optional input file.  Enter name of the doc file containing 
          Eulerian angles (psi, theta, phi) for the reference images.
          Enter '*' if you do not have any reference angles doc file.

         .TEMPLATE FOR IMAGE SERIES TO BE ALIGNED: DATA@***
          [Give the template name of the existing file series of 
          experimental images.  These images will be checked for 
          alignment versus the reference images.]

         .FILE NUMBERS OR SELECTION DOC. FILE NAME: 1-2100
          [Enter numbers of experimental files. The file numbers can also
           be read from a selection document file where file numbers are 
           contained in the first register (not the keys).]

         .OPTIONAL EXPERIMENTAL IMAGES ALIGNMENT DOCUMENT FILE:   angles001
          [Optional input file.  Enter '*' if you do not have a
           alignment doc file.  If you desire to restrict the range of
           angular search for projections then this file is necessary.  It
           must contain the current Eulerian angles of experimental images 
           (projections: psi, theta, phi) and optionally the current 
           inplane rotation, shifts and other alignment parameters.  
           Output files from 'AP SH' and 'AP REF' contain this info.
           If '*' is given then this operation is similar to obsolete
           operation: 'AP MQ'.]

         .RANGE OF PROJECTION ANGLE SEARCH & ANGLE CHANGE THRESHOLD: 20.0, 14.0
          [Experimental images will be compared with only those 
           reference images whose normal is within specified range (in degrees). 
           If a 0.0
           is entered, then there is NO restriction on which of the projections
           are compared. The "angle change threshold" is only used to report what
           percentage of the rotational changes exceed this specified threshold.  This
           value can later be used to halt the iterations.  The value is placed in
           a comment key at the end of the operations output file.  It is
           not used for any other purpose.]

         .CHECK MIRRORED POSITIONS?, SHIFT AND ROTATE INPUT?, DENOISE (Y/N): Y,N
          [Optional check of mirrored reference image. By using this check and
           only providing reference images from one hemisphere of projection 
           directions, speed can be doubled. See note: 2 below.  Optional call
           to rotate and shift input images according to parameters in the 
           experimental images alignment doc. file before determining alignment.
           If this is 'Y' there is no need for 'dala' files.  Optional call to
           lowpass filter experimental images before alignment search.]

         .OUTPUT ALIGNMENT DOCUMENT FILE: align_doc_01
          [Document file containing optimal alignment parameters for each 
           experimental image.  Will append to an existing output file of 
           same name. This document file contains 15 register columns:                                                     
#INCLUDE apdocout_include.also          


NOTES:  1. In 3D space the projection with the direction: (psi, theta, phi)
            has its mirrored (around Y-axis) counterpart in the direction: 
            (-psi, 180+theta, phi)                                  '<br />'
            To save time, the operation can take this into account if you
            speciify 'check mirrored positions'. In this case each experimental
            projection is compared with the reference projection and its
            mirrored version at the same time.  Thus, only half of the total 
            number of reference projections are required; namely, only those
            with 0 < theta < 90.                                           '<br />'
            If the best match was with the mirrored reference projection,
            then the value stored in the 15th register of the document file
            is negative and 
            the projection direction reported in the 1st register column is the 
            proper projection direction for the image.               '<br />'

        2. The reference projections of an existing structure 
           can be created using 'VO EA' and 'PJ 3Q' operations.  'VO EA'
           creates an angular document file with quasi-evenly spaced
           projection directions and 'PJ 3Q' creates projections
           of the volume according to this doc file.

        3. Alignment parameters (angle and translation included in
           columns 6-8 of the output document file) can be used with
           operation 'RT SQ' to align images.

        4. Alignment parameters can be used as input to further 'AP SH'
           or 'AP REF' operations during refinement.

        5. Setting a angular search limit of 180 degrees with checking of mirrored
           positions does not give same results as an unlimited search, since the
           limited search only looks at the nearer projection. This is not a bug.

        6. This operation never was written to provide comprehensive
           sub-pixel resolution.  Normally only about 50% of the shifts 
           are refined to provide sub-pixel estimates.

        7. Sequence of steps in the alignment carried out by this operation: '<br />'

           Load gallery of reference images created by projection of 
           the reference volume.                                     '<br />'

           Extract radial rings from a window of each reference image, 
           converting image to a polar representation.              '<br />'

           Take Fourier transform of the ring data and weight the 
           data corresponding to length and radius.                  '<br />'

           Load a sample image.                                      '<br />'

           Extract radial rings from a window of sample image, 
           coverting image to a polar representation.                '<br />'

           Take Fourier transform of the ring data and weight the 
           data corresponding to length and radius.                  '<br />'

           Perform a cross correlation in Fourier space of the 
           reference and sample data.                                '<br />'

           Find location of highest peak from cross correlation and 
           map it to a rotation angle for the sample image.          '<br />'

           Repeat for all requested X & Y shifts of the sample image. 
           You now have sample shift and rotation.                   '<br />'

           Repeat for next sample image.                             '<br />'
