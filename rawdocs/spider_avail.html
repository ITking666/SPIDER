<h1><b>&nbsp; OBTAINING SPIDER &amp; WEB</b></h1>

<hr>

<p> The distribution consists of two separate modules, SPIDER and
  <i>Web</i>. The SPIDER module is written in FORTRAN and is used for
  mathematical manipulation of images and their contents. The <i>Web</i>
  module is written in <i>C++</i> or in <i>Java</i> and is used for visual
  display and interaction with images created by the SPIDER module or to
  be used by SPIDER. 
 </p>

<p><strong>Platforms:</strong> We regularly run SPIDER/<i>Web</i> on 
  Intel 64 bit Xeons running Linux and AMD  64 bit Opterons running Linux.  
  <b>Note: We phased out support for OSX during 2014.</b>

  Our current standard platform is a Multi-Core Intel based
  machine running SUSE Linux. Heavy computations are done in parallel 
  on a cluster of such machines.  SPIDER requires at
  least 512 Mb of memory.</p>  

<p><strong>On Linux, and other Unix machines:</strong> 
  The current SPIDER and <i>Web</i> modules contain precompiled 
  executables for:
  Linux - 32 & 64 bit AMD and Intel  platforms.  
  The modules also contain all source code, and sample
  <i>Makefiles</i> for module generation on various GNU-Linux
  architectures, OSX, and for IBM SP3/4 systems running AIX.
</p>

<p><strong>On Other systems:</strong> 
  Earlier releases of  SPIDER and <i>Web</i> modules also contained 
  precompiled executables for OSX, SGI Irix, SGI Linux (for Altrix),
  Compaq (Dec) Unix, and Windows.  We no longer compile or support these
  architectures.
</p>

<p><strong>Compilation and linking:</strong>
  It is probable that one of the SPIDER/<i>Web</i> executables which we
  supply will run on your machine.  However the code may have to be
  recompiled and linked for use on some machines. Such compilation will
  require familiarity with the local operating system to set the
  necessary compilation/linking flags and libraries.  Compilation of
  SPIDER requires a Fortran 90 compiler.  We currently use a PGI compiler
  on Linux, and IBM compilers for AIX.
  Compilation and linking of Xwindow WEB requires a <i>C</i> compiler and
  Motif/X-Window libraries on your computer.  The standard <i>gcc</i>
  compiler works well.  Please understand that we may not be able to
  assist with problems you encounter running SPIDER/<i>Web</i> on
  machines other than those listed above. You may be able to  
  <a href="faq.html#viewimg">view</a> SPIDER format images without 
  installing Web.
