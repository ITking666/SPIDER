C    MREAD(LUN,BUF,NSAM,NREC,NPTR)
C 
C       THIS SUBROUTINE IS USED FOR SCROLLING THROUGH AN IMAGE
C	WHERE ONLY NREC IMAGE ROWS ARE KEPT IN THE BUFFER BUF
C	AT A TIME. EACH CALL TO MREAD CAUSES ONE ROW TO BE READ IN
C	TO REPLACE THE 'OLDEST' ROW CURRENTLY IN THE BUFFER. THE
C	ADDRESSES OF THE ROWS IN THE BUFFER ARE BEING ROTATED
C 	ACCORDING TO THE PERMUTATIONS OF THE NUMBERS 1...NREC
C	AN INDEX ARRAY NPTR MAKES THE CURRENT ADDRESSES AVAILABLE.
C
C  PARAMETERS:
C  LUN		LOGICAL UNIT NUMBER OF IMAGE FILE
C  BUF		BUFFER ARRAY OF LENGTH AT LEAST NSAM*NREC
C  NSAM		NUMBER OF ELEMENTS PER ROW
C  NREC		NUMBER OF ROWS IN IMAGE SEGMENT TO BE READ IN
C  NPTR		ARRAY OF LENGTH NREC. NPTR(I) POINTS TO THE LOCATION
C		OF THE I-TH ROW IN THE BUFFER: E.G. IMAGE ROW #8 OF 
C		CURRENT SEGMENT STARTS IN BUFFER LOCATION (NPTR(I)-1)*NSAM+1
C
C	MREAD HAS TO BE INITIALIZED BY 
C			CALL MREAD(-1,BUF,NSAM,NREC,NPTR)
C	THE FIRST CALL WITH NON-NEGATIVE LUN WILL READ IN ALL NREC
C	RECORDS, AND INITIALIZE THE INDEX ARRAY.
C
C 	EACH SUBSEQUENT CALL TO MREAD WILL CAUSE ONE ADDITIONAL ROW
C	TO BE READ IN, WHICH WILL TAKE THE PLACE OF THE "OLDEST" ROW.
C	E.G., THE SECOND CALL WILL READ IN ROW #(NREC+1) AND STORE IT
C	IN THE BUFFER AT THE LOCATION PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED BY THE FIRST
C	IMAGE ROW, AND SO ON.
