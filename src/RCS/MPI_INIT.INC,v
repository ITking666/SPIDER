C     INCLUSION FOR MPI INITIALIZATION.  
C     MUST BE INCLUDED JUST BEFORE FIRST EXECUTABLE
C     MYPID MUST BE SET TO -1 BEFORE THIS INCLUSION

#ifdef USE_MPI
C     IF USING MPI .AND. ONLYONE_RED IS .FALSE. IT ALWAYS READS
C     OTHERWISE, USING MPI, READS ONLY ON PROCESSOR MYPID = 0 

      INTEGER       :: ICOMM,MPIERR

      LOGICAL       :: ONLYONE_RED,ONLYONE_WRT
      COMMON /COMM_MPI/ONLYONE_RED,ONLYONE_WRT
      include 'mpif.h'

      ICOMM  = MPI_COMM_WORLD
      CALL MPI_COMM_RANK(ICOMM, MYPID, MPIERR)

C     ONLYONE_RED IS ALWAYS .TRUE. EXCEPT FROM dsgr_p.f
      IF (.NOT. ONLYONE_RED) MYPID = -1
#endif
