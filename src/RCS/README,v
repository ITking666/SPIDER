1.   GENERAL  

  A. INTRODUCTION
        The operation of the Unix SPIDER module is  similar to the 
     VMS SPIDER module.  Some VMS specific conventions have been 
     carried over into the Unix version.  In  particular,  all files 
     must have a three letter extension (or datacode).  This extension 
    is automatically added by SPIDER.  
      

 B.  DIFFERENCES FROM VAX/VMS VERSION 

     a.  The SPHELP feature of VMS SPIDER has not been implemented yet.
     To get help on a particular operation examine the manual files 
     located in the man subdirectory.  For example, if you want help 
     on the "MO 3" operation look at the file man/mo3.man.
 
     b.  The SPIDER RESULTS files are named RESULTS.EXT.? where ? is
     incremented for each run.

     c.  All commands and input are converted to uppercase letters
     except for interactively entered file-names.

     d.  A *.SYS procedure file must be copied to your working
     directory before it can be used.  *.SYS files are supplied
     in the proc subdirectory.

     e.  Certain commands have not been implemented yet in the
     Unix version. These commands are listed in the unix.doc file.

     f.  There is no display capability in the Unix SPIDER (i.e.
     "TV" commands.  Display is done using WEB.
   
2.   INSTALLATION OF THE SPIDER MODULE.

  A. LOADING THE TAPE
     Code is distributed on QIC 150 tapes in tar format.
     To load the tape use the following commands:

     cd PARENT-DIR.     (where PARENT-DIR is parent for desired 
                         location of SPIDER)
     mkdir spider       (creates a new sub-directory for SPIDER)
     tar xv  spider     (assumes environmental variable TAPE has been 
                         defined for your system) 
      
     The following directories will be created:
             dir                contents

            spider           this file
            spider/src       source code for spider, libraries
            spider/man       documentation
            spider/bin       executable file
            spider/proc      *.SYS files

     The SPIDER src directory contains a makefile which compiles
     the source code, places the object code in a library in the
     src subdirectory, links the object code, and creates an
     executable file driver in the bin subdirectory.

   B. BUILDING SPIDER

     i)  If you have SGI OS version 4.0 (or newer), you probably can
         use the SPIDER driver executable file provided on the  tape. 
         
     ii)  If you have an earlier version of the SGI operating system 
         or a non-SGI Unix system then you  will have to rebuild 
         the SPIDER system from source code.  To use the enclosed
         Makefile to create SPIDER type the following commands:
 
         cd SPIDER_DIR     (where SPIDER-DIR is  location of SPIDER)
         make

         note:  the archive (ar) command in the make file will
         use a lot of space in your TMPDIR.  If you get a message
         about no space being left on your device I suggest you
         redefine TMPDIR to a directory that has space (e.g.):
         setenv TMPDIR /usr/tmp

         On non-SGI machines you will have the alter the makefile
         to incorporate the correct libraries, compiler flags, etc.
         for your system.  You may also have to alter the logic in
         the Makefile as the make command works differently on
         different flavors of Unix.

   B. OTHER
         Assign the location of the manual files (usually SPIDER-DIR/man)
         to the environmental variable SPMAN_DIR.  If you are using 
         the 'C' shell, you would put a line similar to the following
         in your .cshrc file:

         setenv SPMAN_DIR /usr1/spider/man/
 
3. DOCUMENTATION
              There is an over-view of SPIDER documentation in the
          file: intro.doc in the ./man sub-directory

4. TESTING THE SYSTEM
 
         In this and the following tests, use the SPIDER manual to check
         the proper usage of commands and the expected performance of
         the operations.
 
   A.  TESTING INTERACTIVE OPERATIONS

                 spider
                .ENTER PROJECT/DATA CODE: PRJ/DAT
                .OPERATION:

         TEST #1 : try operation 'ME'. This should give you the list of
         commands. (Note that all commands are listed, including some 
         not contained in the out-of-Albany program set)
 
         TEST#2 : Test arithmetic operations.  These are the so-called 
         pocket calculator functions which allow a wide range of 
         arithmetic expressions to be computed.  Expressions should be 
         entered in the same way as FORTRAN arithmetic expressions 
         appear in a FORTRAN source program, e.g. ((3-0.26)/4)**2.  
         See USER.DOC for more details.
 
         TEST#3 : Test the use of registers and document file. Execute 
         the sequence
                        X10=2
                        X20=5
                        SD 1,X10,X20
                        DOC001
                        UD 1,X40,X50
                        DOC001
                        X40
                        X50
 
        The values 2 and 5 stored in the registers X10 and X20 should 
        have been saved in DOC001.PRJ under the key 1 and subsequently 
        unsaved into the registers X40, X50.  Upon entering 'X40', 
        the system should respond with '2.00000', and upon 'X50', 
        it should respond with '5.00000'.  
 
  B.  TESTING A SIMPLE PROCEDURE RUN.
 
        Copy MO1.PRJ from the man directory to your current 
        directory, then:

                 spider
                .ENTER PROJECT/DATA CODE: PRJ/DAT
                .OPERATION: MD
                .MODE: TR ON
                .OPERATION: @@MO1
 
        'MO1'  refers to a file MO1.PRJ that is part of this package,
        containing exactly the sequence previously entered in the 
        interactive mode.  The procedure  sequence as well as the 
        overprint display will be contained in  RESULTS.PRJ, which 
        can be printed on a line printer.
