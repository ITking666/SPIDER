          Installing SPIDER's Python Tools

The tools require Python, Tcl/Tk and several other Python libraries 
(Image, Gnuplot, numpy, Pmw). This full installation of tools 
includes its own version of Python and these other packages. The 
installation assumes that you already have SPIDER installed on 
your system.

Go to the SPIDER tools directory and extract the tools tar archive:

   cd /YOUR_SPIDER_DIRECTORY/tools
   tar xvf tools.tar

Run the shell script: ./install.sh to complete the installation. 
This script and the python script that it invokes (install.py) 
compiles the python code and sets up an appropriate environment.

   cd /YOUR_SPIDER_DIRECTORY/tools
   ./install.sh

Various executables are located in: /YOUR_SPIDER_DIRECTORY/tools/bin. 
The '*.py' files (ctfmatch.py, qview.py, etc.) are python programs. 
The corresponding files without the '.py' extension 
(ctfmatch, qview, etc.) are shell scripts that call the Python 
programs with the new python installed in the tools/bin directory, 
thus making sure the environment is set up properly.

If you did not allow the install script to alter your shell startup 
files you will have to edit them yourself:

    If you are using csh, add the: tools/bin directory to your path 
    by adding the following line in your .cshrc file (substituting 
    for the correct value for 'YOUR_SPIDER_DIRECTORY'):
         setenv PATH /YOUR_SPIDER_DIRECTORY/tools/bin:$PATH

    or if you are using bash add the: tools/bin directory to your 
    path by adding the following lines in your .bashrc file
    (substituting for the correct value for 'YOUR_SPIDER_DIRECTORY'):
         PATH=/YOUR_SPIDER_DIRECTORY/tools/bin:$PATH
         export PATH 

This installation will only use SPIDER's python to run the 
executable scripts in the /YOUR_SPIDER_DIRECTORY/tools/bin directory. 
It will not superceed any previously installed python on your system.
