Do you accept these terms? (accept,decline) accept

A network installation will save disk space by having only one copy of the 
compilers and most of the libraries for all compilers on the network, and  
the main installation needs to be done once for all systems on the network.
1  Single system install
2  Network install      
Please choose install option: 1

Pease specify the directory path under which the software will be installed.
The default directory is /opt/pgi, but you may install anywhere you wish,    
assuming you have permission to do so.                                       

Installation directory? [/opt/pgi] /usr10/pgi
Note: /usr10/pgi seems to contain a previous installation.
    This installation may fail to install files properly. 
    You may see messages from tar about file permissions, etc.

his release of PGI software includes the ACML, which is a tuned math library
designed for high performance on AMD64 machines, including Opteron(TM) and   
Athlon(TM) 64, and includes both 32-bit and 64-bit library versions.         

More information about the ACML can be found at the AMD Developer web site, 
http://www.developwithamd.com/acml                                          

Install the ACML? (y/n) y
Do you accept these terms? (accept,decline) accept

This PGI version links with ACML 5.3.0 by default.  Also available:
  (1) ACML 5.3.0                                                   
  (2) ACML 5.3.0 using FMA4                                        
Enter another value to override the default (1)                    


This release contains CUDA 5.0 and CUDA 5.5.  If you have not installed
these versions from PGI previously, you should install these now.      
Install CUDA Toolkit Components? (y/n) y

Do you accept these terms? (accept,decline) accept

Do you wish to install MPICH1? (y/n) y
Remote execution method? (rsh,ssh) ssh

Do you wish to generate license keys? (y/n) y

There are two ways to obtain a license key for the PGI compilers and tools:

1. Invoke PGI's license generation tool
   /usr10/pgi/linux86/13.10/bin/pgi_license_tool

2. Login to your PGI account on www.pgroup.com.  The hostid information for
   this computer is shown below, and is also in the file /usr10/pgi/license.info.

   Place your license key in the file /usr10/pgi/license.dat.

System information:

   FLEXnet hostid  "003048c614f2 003048c614f3"
   Hostname        valcour.wadsworth.org
   Installation    /usr10/pgi
   PGI Release     13.10

   Note: If more than one 12-digit hostid is shown, use only one in
         generating your license.

The above information was saved to /usr10/pgi/license.info.

The PGI license tool can be re-started by running the script located at
/usr10/pgi/linux86/13.10/bin/pgi_license_tool.

All PGI software is license-managed.  This program will walk you through the
steps required to download and install your license keys.   An active Internet
connection is required.  If you don't have an Internet connection, please see
the PGI Installation Guide that came with your software for alternatives on
generating and installing license keys.

You will need to know the following information.

* Does this computer access the Internet directly or through some sort of
  proxy connection?
* If a proxy is used, you'll need the address (URL) of the proxy server.
* Does the proxy require authentication?  If so, you'll need to know the
  username and password.
* To login to the PGI website to generate license keys, you need either a
  PGI web account (username and password) or a PIN code from the PGI order
  confirmation email message from PGI Sales.

If this computer is behind a firewall at your site, please make sure it can
access the Internet.
