<b><h2 align="center">Classification of Images</h2></b>


<p>
<a href="../../glossary.html#Classification">Classification</a> is a 
computational procedure that sorts images into groups ("classes")
according to their similarities.  Images can be similar in all kinds of
ways, but in EM-related image processing we use a very strict measure
of similarity that is based on a pixel-by-pixel comparison: the mean
squared difference, a.k.a. <i>generalized Euclidean distance</i>.
</p>

<p>
Images represented by N x N arrays of density values can be thought of
as points in an N x N-dimensional space.  Points that are close to each
other in that space represent images that are "similar" since the mean

There are two different approaches to classification: <i>supervised</i>
and <i>unsupervised</i>.  Both make use of the similarity measure
introduced above,
 but one (supervised) classifies a set of images according to their
 similarity (speak: closeness in our high-dimensional space) with
certain pre-given images ("references" or "templates"), the other
(unsupervised) classifies the images according to their intrinsic
grouping or clustering within the set.
</p>

<p>This is demonstrated schematically in the figure.  The same set of
images, represented by a set of dots, is either classified by comparing
each image with a set of references (represented by fat dots), or by
dividing the whole cloud of dots into clusters (indicated by dashed
line).

<p>
For simplification of the analysis, or for the purpose of increasing
the signal-to-noise ratio, classification is often carried out in a
space that is of much lower dimensionality than the initial N x N
space.  This reduction of dimensionality is achieved by Multivariate
Data Analysis (also known as 
<a href="../MSA/index.htm">multivariate statistical analysis</a>).  

The two most common techniques in EM are

and principal component analysis</a>.
