    (links lead to output from faces example). </p>

<ul>
   <p> 

   <li><a href="save/cas_ca_IMC.dat"><i>*_IMC</i></a> is a text file 
      that stores the coordinates of each IMAGE in the new vector space. The 
      contents on the first line are:     <p />
  
        <table class="small" border=1 padding-left="10" >
	<tr><td>&nbsp; NUMIM</td>     <td>&nbsp; # of images included in analysis         </td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp; NFAC</td>      <td>&nbsp; # of factors requested, entry to "number of factors" question </td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp; NX, NY</td>    <td>&nbsp; X and Y values of images, respectively   </td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp; NUMIM</td>     <td>&nbsp; # of images included in analysis         </td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp; PCA</td>       <td>&nbsp; 1 if PCA analysis was used, 0 if CA used </td></tr>
	</table>

    <p> There is a line for each image included. The contents of this line are:
        <table  class="small" border=1>
	<tr><td>&nbsp; IMAGE(#)...NFAC)</td><td>&nbsp;  Coordinates for each image, in the vector space. 
                                                        The number of entries depend on how many factors were 
                                                        requested.                            </td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp; WEIGHTP</td>         <td>&nbsp;  Relative weight of each image, = # of pixels in 
                                                        this image/# of pixels in all images  </td></tr>

	</table>
   </li> 

   <li><a href="save/cas_ca_PIX.dat"><i>*_PIX</i></a> is a text file that stores 
        the coordinates of each PIXEL. Very similar to <i>*_IMC</i>. The contents on 
        the first line are:    <p />

        <table  class="small" border=1>
	<tr><td>&nbsp; NPIX</td>      <td>&nbsp;  # of pixels included in each image, determined by the mask</td></tr>

	<tr><td>&nbsp; PCA</td>       <td>&nbsp;  1 if PCA analysis was used, 0 if CA used  </td></tr>
	</table>

        <table  class="small" border=1>

                                                          space. The number of entries depend on how many 
                                                          factors were requested.               </td></tr>

   </li>

   <li><a href="save/cas_ca_EIG.dat">*_EIG</a> is a text file that stores 
        the eigenvector values. The contents on the first line are:<p />

    <li>*_SEQ is a binary file that stores all image pixel values 
        within the mask from all the images. 
        <b>NOT</b> SPIDER image. Only useful internally within other 
        'CA' &amp; 'CL' operations.

    <p>
    <li>*_SET is a binary file with transposed data.
