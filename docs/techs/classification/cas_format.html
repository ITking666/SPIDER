   <li><a href="save/cas_ca_IMC.dat"><i>*_IMC</i></a> is a text file 
      that stores the coordinates of each IMAGE in the new vector space. The 
      contents on the first line are:     <p />
  
        <table class="small" border=1 padding-left="10" >
	<tr><td>&nbsp; NUMIM</td>     <td>&nbsp; # of images included in analysis </td>
	<tr><td>&nbsp; NFAC</td>      <td>&nbsp; # of factors requested, entry to "number of factors" question </td>
	<tr><td>&nbsp; NX, NY</td>    <td>&nbsp; X and Y values of images, respectively </td>
	<tr><td>&nbsp; NUMIM</td>     <td>&nbsp; # of images included in analysis </td>
	<tr><td>&nbsp; PCA</td>       <td>&nbsp; 1 if PCA analysis was used, 0 if CA used </td>

    <p> There is a line for each image included. The contents of this line are:
        <table  class="small" border=1>
	<tr><td>&nbsp; IMAGE(#)...NFAC)</td><td>&nbsp;  Coordinates for each image, in the vector space. 
                                          The number of entries depend on how many factors were 
                                          requested. </td>

   <li><a href="save/cas_ca_PIX.dat"><i>*_PIX</i></a> is a text file that stores 
        the coordinates of each PIXEL. Very similar to <i>*_IMC</i>. The contents on

	<tr><td>&nbsp; PCA</td>       <td>&nbsp;  1 if PCA analysis was used, 0 if CA used </td>
	</table>

    <p>There is a line for each pixel included. The outputs for this are:<p />

                                            space. The number of entries depend on how many

   <li><a href="save/cas_ca_EIG.dat">*_EIG</a> is a text file that stores 
        the eigenvector values. The contents on the first line are:<p />

        <table class="small" border=1>

    <p>There is a line for each factor requested. The outputs for this are:

	</table>

    <p>If PCA was used there are additional lines. 
        The outputs for these are: 
        <table class="small" border=1>
	<tr><td>&nbsp; AVERAGE(#)...N )<td>&nbsp; %</td>&nbsp;  Average for this image or pixel</td>

    <li>*_SEQ is a binary file that stores all image pixel values 
        within the mask from all the images. 
        <b>NOT</b> SPIDER image. Only useful internally within other 
        'CA' &amp; 'CL' operations. 
    </li> 
    </p>

    <p>
    <li>*_SET is a binary file with transposed data. 
        <b>NOT</b> a SPIDER image. Only useful internally within other 
        'CA' &amp; 'CL' operations. 
    </li>
