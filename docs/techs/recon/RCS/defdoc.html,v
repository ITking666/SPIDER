<h3>Make CTF</h3>

The SPIDER operation <a href="../../man/tf.html"><b>TF</b></a>
creates an image of the contrast transfer function at various
defocus settings. See pages 32-33 in Dr. Frank's book, <i>3D EM of
Macromolecular Assemblies</i>. 

<p>The procedure file <a href="./newprogs/makectf.bat">makectf.bat</a>
uses <b>TF</b> to create such an image.</p>

<p>The resulting CTF file is used as input to def.bat</p>

<hr>
<p><a name="DEFOCUS"></a></p>

<h3>Estimate defocus: def.bat</h3>

<p>The procedure file <a href="./newprogs/def.bat">def.bat</a> takes a
1D CTF data file (roo*** - created by <a href=
"./newprogs/power.bat">power.bat</a>) and a 2D CTF model file as
inputs. The roo*** file is compared to all the defocus settings in
the model file; the best match is output as the estimated defocus
value. The matching algorithm compares the derivative of the data
file aagainst the derivative of each CTF defocus line, in order to
emphasize the maxima &amp; minima.</p>

<p><b>Usage:</b> at the unix prompt, type</p>

<pre>
def ctf_file roo***  [1=verbose output]
</pre>

NB: the verbose_output flag is optional. 

<p><i>def</i> is a C program used to estimate defocus. <a href=
"def/def.c">def.c source code</a></p>

<p><b>Inputs:</b></p>

<p><u>ctf_file</u> : A 2D image of the contrast transfer function
(see above).</p>

<p><u>roo*** file</u> : The 1D rotationally averaged CTF function,
e.g., roo022.dat. This file was created by power.bat, the SPIDER
procedure file for Contrast Transfer Function estimation.</p>

<p><u>verbose_output flag</u> [optional] : If this flag is set to
1, numerous files are written out, which may be viewed in gnuplot
(see below). The x axis of (almost) all these plots is in the same
spatial frequency units as the input roo*** file.</p>

<p><b>Outputs</b></p>

<p>The program prints to the screen the micrograph number and the
estimated defocus value, in a format compatible with SPIDER
document files. E.g.,</p>

<pre>
   1  2      1.000   37200.000
</pre>

where 37200 is the defocus calculated for roo001.dat. The results
are checked for "goodness", i.e., a single narrow peak in the
correlation output. If the results appear suspicious, a warning is
also also printed out. Files producing warnings should always be
checked. 

<p>Repeated calls to <i>def</i> may be used to create a doc file
that lists defocus values for all micrographs:</p>

<pre>
x11 = 1   ; start micrograph
x12 = 20  ; end micrograph

DO LB1 x20 = x11,x12
   VM
   def ctf001.dat roo{***x20}.dat &gt;&gt; defdoc.dat
LB1
EN D
</pre>

In the output line, the key number will be the same as the
micrograph number. If the numbers do not start at 1, or they are
not sequential, use <a href="../../man/docren.html"><b>DOC
REN</b></a> to renumber the keys. <br>
Note: the <a href="../../man/vm.html"><b>VM</b></a> command
requires file names to include the extensions. 

<p><i>If verbose_output is set to 1, the following files are also
created:</i></p>

<p><b>nro001</b> A normalized version of the original data file,
useful for comparing it to other outputs.</p>

<p><b>ctf001</b> The model CTF of the best matching defocus. E.g.,
if the estimated defocus is 27700, then the best match was line 277
of the 2D CTF model file.</p>

<p>The input data and the best matching model CTF may be compared
in gnuplot with the following commands:</p>

<pre>
set yrange [0:1]
plot "nro001" using 1:3 with lines, "ctf001" using 1:3 with lines
</pre>

<b>dx001</b> The first derivative of the data file. 

<p><b>ctfdx001</b> The first derivative of the model CTF file.</p>

<p>The derivatives may be compared in gnuplot with the following
commands:</p>

<pre>
f(x) = 0
set yrange [-0.5:0.5]
plot "dx001" using 1:3 with lines, f(x), "ctfdx001" using 1:3 with lines
</pre>

The derivatives are useful for seeing how well the high frequency
components match. A set of roo*** files that are tentatively
assigned to the same defocus group can also be compared to each
other in this way. 

<p><b>res001</b> Result (correlation output) of the matching
operation between the roo*** file data and CTF lines. In this case,
the x axis is in defocus units. The maximum value of this array is
selected as the estimated defocus value. 
<!---   COMMENTED OUT THESE LINES
<p>
<b>min001</b> (001 = number of roo*** file): List of minima, along the spatial frequency dimension.

</p>

<p><a name="DEFGRP"></a></p>

<h3>Assign micrographs to defocus groups: defgrp.bat</h3>

<p>The procedure file <a href="./newprogs/defgrp.bat">defgrp.bat</a>
reads the defocus.ext doc file created by <a href=
"./newprogs/def.bat">def.bat</a>, sorts the data according to
defocus values, adds another column representing the defocus group,
and writes this out as another doc file: defsort.ext</p>

<p>THE DEFOCUS GROUPINGS MUST BE CHECKED! The algorithm simply
checks if two defocus values are within a specified distance (the
"maximum difference" register, near the top of defgrp.bat) from
each other.</p>

<hr>
<p><a name="DEFAVG"></a></p>

<h3>Determine defocus group averages: defavg.bat</h3>

<p>Once the defocus groups have been decided, the procedure file <a
href="./newprogs/defavg.bat">defavg.bat</a> reads the defsort.ext
doc file created by <a href="./newprogs/defgrp.bat">defgrp.bat</a>,
and computes the average for each defocus group. The output doc
file, defgroup_avg.ext, has 4 columns:<br>
(1) micrograph number<br>
(2) defocus value for that micrograph<br>
(3) defoucs group<br>
(4) defocus group average</p>
