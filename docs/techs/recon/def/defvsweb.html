<center><h3>Comparison of defocus estimates: manual (Web) vs automated (def)</h3></center>

Defocus was estimated in rotationally averaged power spectra (roo*** files), first in <b>Web</b>, 
then by the program <b>def</b>. Results are compared below.

<p>
The automated program worked better on newer, higher quality data, so the results are split into two groups. 
<p>
New data (40s, 43s, 70s, eft) were generally acquired with a FEG, scanned by ZI to 2.82 pixels/A.
<p>
Older data (etu, rrf, ryr, acn) used Lab6, HiScan, with 4.78 .. 5.18 pixels/A.

units are defocus values
<p>
Conclusion? Better data give more accurate results.
