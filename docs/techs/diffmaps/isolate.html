<center> <h2>Isolating Ligands from 3D Ribosome Reconstructions</h2></center>

<p>There are several ways to identify or isolate small masses in 3D
reconstructions:</p>

<ul class="noindent">

<li>A procedure file for constructing 
  <a href= "./recon/mr.html#OTHER">difference maps</a> is on the 
  <a href="./recon/mr.html">Single Particle Reconstruction</a> 
  page. The statistics of the volumes may be used to determine the significance
  of 3-dimensional features (see pages 252-254 in
  <i>Three-Dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular Assemblies</i> 
  by J. Frank).
</li>
<p />

<li>Alternatively, the SPIDER operation 
  <a href= "../man/drdiff.html">DR DIFF</a> computes the error and difference
  between two volumes.
</li>
<p />

<li>For display and illustration purposes, the set of operations in
  the recipe below may be entered interactively to extract and
  isolate a mass from a volume:
