<p>
   Differences between volumes can be assessed by subtracting one
   volume from the other; the result is a <i>difference map</i>. 
   Such differences provide one way to identify or isolate small masses 
   in 3D reconstructions. The
   statistics of the volumes may be used to determine the significance
   of 3-dimensional features (see pages 252-254 in
   <i>Three-Dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular
   Assemblies</i> by J. Frank). </p>

<p>Before subtracting volumes, make sure they are properly aligned.</p>

<ul>

<p><li>Check alignment of two volumes. 
   <a href="../recon1a/Procs/shiftvol.spi">shiftvol.spi</a> uses 
   <a href="../../man/cc.html">CC</a> and 
   <a href="../../man/pk3.html">PK 3</a> to determine if volumes 
   are shifted relative to each other.</li></p>

<p><li>Ligands can be isolated by creating a difference map. 
   <a href= "../recon1a/Procs/diffmap.spi">diffmap.spi</a> 
   computes difference bewteen two volumes.
</li></p>

<p> <li>Alternatively, the SPIDER operation 
   <a href="../../man/drdiff.html">DR DIFF</a> 
   computes the error and difference
   between two volumes.
</li></p>

<p><li>For display and illustration purposes, this 
   <a href="isolate.html">recipe of interactive 
   operations</a> may be entered in SPIDER to extract and
   isolate a mass from a volume:
   </li> </p>

</ul>
