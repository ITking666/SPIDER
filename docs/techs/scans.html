<p>The same micrograph was scanned in both the HiScan and ZI
scanners. Overview #2 was extracted from the ZI scan for
comparison.</p>

<p>HiScan file: raw015.tif<br>
size: 5336 x 6836 pixels<br>
pixel size (A): 2.93<br>
</p>

<p>ZI scan file: raw0267, overview #2<br>
size: 5546 x 7145 pixels<br>
pixel size (A): 2.82<br>
</p>

<p>Note that the zeroes in the ZI scan are better defined and are
discernible at higher resolution. (Scales are slightly different
due to the different pixel sizes.)</p>
