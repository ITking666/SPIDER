; Derived from: b12.pam
;
; Master copy location: /net/bali/usr1/spider/docs/techs/parallel
;
; Multireference alignment of an image series. 
; Aligns particles to reference projections.  For project
; with multiple defocus settings, run this program separately
; for particles from each individual micrograph.
; Memory usage is heaaviley dependent on number of images and ring 
;    requests.  For 83 125x125 images and rings at 5...47
;    memory was ~3.6 MB and process size was: 45MB.
;   
; If pixel size is different than 4.78, expected size of object and
; first and last ring parameters should be changed
; 
; INPUT NEEDED:
; out/prj****              (2-D reference images)
; select                   (Selection doc file for refs. from b11.pam) 
; win_part@@*****           (Windowed images from micrograph)   
; myinput/ngood{***grp}    (Selection doc files for windowed images)
; X77 (on command line)    (Micrograph number)
;
; OUTPUT CREATED:
; out/apmq{***x77}         (Alignment doc files)
