<h2 align="center">TOMOGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION DATABASE</h2>

<ul>

<li><h4>Archiving using the database at Albany.</h4>

   <ul>

     <li>The web-based tomography database is designed to make it easy to 
       keep track of the reconstructions.  It also serves as a means for 
       archiving all the necessary data from each reconstruction. It was
       written, and is maintained by 
       <a href= "mailto:yuchen@wadsworth.org">Yu Chen</a>.</li><p/>

     <li><b>Database location:</b> From SGI workstations, use
       <a href= "http://newton15-250/archivedb/search_t.asp">
       http://newton15-250/archivedb/search_t.asp</a>.<br/>

       From PC's use
       <a href= "http://luzon/archivedb/search_T.asp"> http://luzon/archivedb/search_T.asp</a>.
       </li><p/>
   </ul>

<li><h4>Use of the database to find information on reconstructions.</h>

     <ul>
     <li><b>Viewing a database page:</b> 
        You can select the page (i.e.
       project or reconstruction) you want to see from the default list, or
       you can generate a new list of pages based on a search.  Any word(s) in
       the database text can be entered, and the search can be refined by any
       of the categories in the pull-down lists.  You can also sort the listed
       pages according to any of the column headings of the list table, just
       by clicking on the heading.</li><p/>

   <li><b>Security:</b> You can look at all the information on any page,
       and you can download any of the data which was archived, but editing
       the information or uploading more data requires a password.</li><p/>

   <li><b>Downloads:</b> Click on the category of data you want to
       download.  You will be prompted for where you want to put the downloaded
       file.  Each category has only one associated file.  In the case of the
       "raw data files", "marker files", and "procedure and other doc files", the
       original individual files will have been saved as a single zipped,
       compressed file.  Accordingly, they will end in Z.  After you download
       the zipped files, you will have to extract the original files.</li><p/>

   <li><b>Extracting zipped files:</b>On the PC, you can use WINzip to
       extract any or all of the files desired.  On the SGI, you will have to
       uncompress, then tar the file, which will restore all the original
       files. For "raw data files" type <b>uncompress raw.tar.Z</b>, then
       <b>tar xvf raw.tar</b>.  For "marker files" type <b>uncompress
       mrk.tar.Z</b>, then <b>tar xvf mrk.tar</b>.  For "procedure and other doc
       files" type <b>uncompress misc.tar.Z</b>, then <b>tar xvf
       misc.tar</b>.  </li><p/>
   </ul>
   </li>

<li><h4>Entering information in the database<h4>
   <ul>
   <li><b>Entering a new reconstruction:</b> Chose any existing database
       page, then click on the "Add" button.  A blank database page will
       appear, ready to edit.  When you choose the author from the list, you
       will have to use the password for that author for any future editing.  
       If you know the password, you can change it any time.  If you chose 
       "other" as an author, the data will not be password protected.</li><p/>

   <li><b>Pasting text:</b> You can paste large text blocks into the
       database windows.  For example, you can paste in your whole "info.dat"
       text, if you are still making one in addition to the information you
       put in the database.  You should paste in all the marker alignment
       results, from the data saved in the errors files.  Although the windows
       are small in the edit mode, when the data is displayed your text will
       look as it did in your original window.</li><p/>

   <li><b>Saving text:</b> Just click on the "Save" button.
       <b>Important:</b> You must first save the text before uploading any
       data files.  If you put in all the text, then click on "Upload Image
       and Other Files" without having saved the text, the text will be
       blank.</li><p/>

   <li><b>To upload data files:</b>Type the complete location path of the
       file you want to upload in the appropriate box.  This information is
       just a record of where the files were originally.  When you click on
       "Upload Image and Other Files", you can either again type (or paste)
       the complete location path of the files in the boxes provided, or you
       can use the browse utility provided.  You don't have to fill in all the
       boxes at each upload.</li><p/>

   <li><b>Sample image:</b>You should prepare a JPG image of a sample
       z-slice from the volume. It will be used on the database page as an aid
       in identifying the reconstruction.  You will be asked for this file
       when you do an upload. A small version of the image will be shown when
       the database page is displayed.  If you click on the small image, you
       will get the full-size image.  So you could alternatively put a montage
       of several slices, or some slices and a model here.</li><p/>

   <li><b>Compressing/zipping files:</b>The "raw data files", "marker
       files", and "procedure and other doc files" have to be zipped and
       compressed to only one file per category.  On the PC, use WINzip.  On
       the SGI, this can be done on a single command line.  For example, to
       make a compressed file of all the raw images, use <b>tar cvf - raw* |
       gzip > raw.tar.Z</b>.  For the marker document files, use <b>tar cvf -
       d_* | gzip > mrk.tar.Z</b>. For all the other document files (assuming
       you use the naming conventions suggested in this webpage), use <b>tar
       cvf - A* S* b* c* i* | gzip > misc.tar.Z</b>  This will make the three
       files: raw.tar.Z, mrk.tar.Z, and misc.tar.Z which you can put into the
       database.  If you wish to save more than one reconstructed volume,
       you can zip them together using <b>tar
       cvf - vol* | gzip > vol.tar.Z</b></li><p/>

   <li><b>Archiving:</b>Storing data in the database is an alternative to
       archiving it on a CDROM.  The database is maintained and backed up
       with the intention of being a "safe" place for long-term archiving.</li><p/>
