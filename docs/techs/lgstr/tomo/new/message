Christian and Chyongere,

You need:

/net/flores/usr6/people/marko/NEW_PROCEDURE_FILES/IVEMbin.dat       

to convert the files and do a final gain correction to get rid of the 
line in the image due to the two-column defect.

You must also take four dark images (i.e. screen down). 
 
For convenience, I name them  dark1.bin - dark4.bin.  
 
You also need to take four images of an empty part of the grid using the same
mean you used for the tomographic series.

For convenience, I name them  gain1.bin - gain4.bin.

With the 1.8 nm pixel size, the tilt axis is about 45 degrees, so you 
will then have to window or pad the images.  Other pixel sizes will have  
a different rotatation.  Once we determine the rotation more precisely,   
perhaps we can add that to the proceedure.





I have some images (and one movie) ready for Power Point:

they are all in dir:  /net/bali/usr1/spider/dev/wkshp/pp

The order I will show them is:
