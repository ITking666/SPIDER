Need to read corrections file and find max negative and max
positive shifts for both x and y

compare first value with next value.  If less than replace current
with new min
If greater than replace new max

x22=min
x23=max

ud
x22=first value

do lb1 x80=key1,keylast

ud

if(x11.lt.x22)x22=x11
if(x12.gt.x23)x23=x12

ifless than zero


lb1
