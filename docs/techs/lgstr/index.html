<h2 align="center">Procedures for electron tomography, serial-section 
   reconstruction, and related visualization methods</h2>

<hr />

<p> These are the procedures used at Albany for making electron
tomographic reconstructions from both single- and double-tilt series of
projection images, for making serial-section reconstructions, and for
visualizing and displaying the reconstructions.</p>

<p> We apply these techniques to objects as large as whole cells 
(using serial-section reconstruction) and to organelles such as mitochondria, 
centosomes, and kinetochores (using electron tomography of thick 
sections).  We also use these techniques for electron tomography of whole-
mount, frozen hydrated specimens such as isolated mitochondria, 
skeletal-muscle triad junctions, and sperm axonemes.</p>
