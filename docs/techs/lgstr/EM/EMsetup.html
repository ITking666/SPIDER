<LI>Check that the time is set to 1000ms. 
<LI>Select FORMAT. 
<LI>Turn on beam blank. 
<LI>Select PHOTO to turn off beam blanker and lower screen. 
<LI>Set exposure to about 40pA on the small focussing screen if test CCD exposures
are to be made before proceeding. 
<LI>Be sure the microscope is aligned well for the conditions to be used. Note
the special alignment of the condenser system for minimum movement of the
illuminated area with focus change.

instructions, to yield the maximum open area at high tilt, and to allow
the possibility of stage alignment under low-dose conditions. ADJUSTMENT
OF THE STAGE ALIGNMENT SCREWS IS ONLY TO BE DONE BY IVEM STAFF.) </P>
<OL>
<LI>Set the mag. to 6000X. For 400kV only, set the condenser minilens (CM) to
PRTEST M1: 66BA using the command SETLNS 3 &amp;H66BA typed on the EM keyboard.
This command is defined as the &quot;F4&quot; macro--press F$, then return. 
<LI>Take up the rotation backlash for a double-tilt series: Drive the rotation
of the stage using the computer to -20 degrees, then back to zero. Later,
for the second tilt, you will rotate the grid in the positive direction
(using medium speed) to 90 degrees. NOTES: (1) If you need to pre-orient
the specimen by rotation before the first tilt series, you will still need
to take up the backlash after you determine the starting rotation position.
(2) If using the foot pedal or pushbutton switch for rotation after the
first tilt series, be sure the switch is set in the positive direction. 
<LI>Adjust the stage height (z) for minimum movement of the specimen in the
range +/-30 degrees. 
<LI>Put a feature at the center of the screen at zero degrees tilt using the
stage translations. 
<LI>Tilt to -60 degrees. 
<LI>Turn the screw to the left of the objective aperture (using a 5mm hex key)
to move the image back to the center. Note that the image may move off to
one side, as well as up or down (i.e. it may move in both x and y at the
same time). Ignore the movement to the side (x), just put the image on the
same vertical (y) level as the center of the screen. 
<LI>Tilt back to zero degrees and recenter the object with the stage translations. 
<LI>Carefully readjust the stage height for minimum movement, while tilting
through the whole range (a very small change in height can make a significant
difference in movement). 
<LI>Repeat the alignment if the image moves more than 2 cm when tilting from
-60 to +60. Try to keep the movement not more than 1 cm.

calibration).

<LI>Exchange test specimen for cryo specimen, center grid, check goniometer
alignment in center grid square. 
<LI>Tilt to -60 
<LI>Move not more than +/- 2 grid squares, in X ONLY for searching. 
<LI>Go to (A)scanning, center prospective object to reconstruct on mark on TV,
focus and take CCD image for more clarity 
<LI>If object might be OK, go to (E)xposure and take CCD image (E) to confirm,
also to check intensity. 
<LI>If object is OK, take CCD images in (S)earch, (Tracking) and (Focus) to
be sure there is something to track and focus on, and that the intensities
are OK. 
<LI>If OK, start the series. 
</OL>
<P>NOTE: If the tilt increment is to be 4 degrees, search still needs to be
set at 2 degrees to properly follow the specimen </P>

<OL>
<LI>Must be in the semi-automatic mode. 
<LI>At (T)racking, use C to move the cursor IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ERROR (e.g.,
if the object is too high, move the cursor up beyond the red circle) 
<LI>When finished moving, use q. 
<LI>Use S to apply the change 5. Use E to make a new reference image. The new
reference image will have moved in the OPPOSITE direction as the cursor,
i.e., in the direction you wanted to move the object.
