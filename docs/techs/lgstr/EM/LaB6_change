Source change procedure

1.  Clean dust off outside of gun.
2.  Close Gun IP valve tightly so IP can stay on.
3.  Turn off leak test.
4.  Switch gun lift switch to down
5.  Set gun pressure switch to off
6.  Open N2 tank.
7.  Press gun leak.  IP should not turn off.  If it does, note step
    28).
8.  Wait for gun to air.
9.  Move locking bar to unlock gun.
10. Switch gun lift to up.
11. Guide gun to lift straight up
12. If gun lifts too slowly, turn the thumbwheel on the upper
    valve a little.
13. Swing out the gun.
14. Make sure the grounding spring touches the Wehnelt. 
-------------------------------------------
15. Change the Wehnelt assembly.  Set the FEI crystal 1.2 turns below
    the surface of the Wehnelt, and precisely center.
16. Remove the anode with the special tool; clean and replace. 
17. Cover the gun chamber with aluminium foil.
18. Clean the cone with acetone or freon and regrease with special 
    silicone grease.
19. Check the o-ring, regrease with Apiezon L, if needed.
20. Clean the gun chamber, if needed, with actone, then freon.
21. Swing the gun back and lower it.
22. Cycle the pressure 2 or three times, (lock gun first?)
23. Lift the gun again and check for good contact of the grease
    on the cone, add grease if necessary.
24. Lower the gun, and cycle the pressure 2-3 times
25. Lock the gun.
26. Set pressure to on and lift to up.
27. Pump the gun until Pirani gauge reads mid scale on green.
    (If off, the IP should come on)
28. Open the IP valve (if IP was off while gun was at air, be prepared
    for an increase in pressure).
29. Wait for normal gun pressure (overnight should be long enough)

-------------------------------------------

30. When the gun is 1 x 10-5 Pa, start conditioning.  Slowly increase
    HT, keeping pressure below 2 x 10-5 Pa at all times.  If a 
    pressure spike occurs, wait until pressure drops before
    continuing.  Wait about 10min at 400kV, when finished.
31. Set HT to 80kV and bias to 1-1
32. Open gun valve and start to heat filament.
33. Take 30-45 min to bring it to operating temperature (estimated to
    be at a knob setting of 7).
34. Continue filament heating until the pressure returns to 1 x 10-5Pa.
35. Rcondition HT, this time going to 410kV
36. Reheat filament and align gun
