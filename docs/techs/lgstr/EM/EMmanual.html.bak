<OL>
<LI>Check the film sensitivity setting. For SO-163 film developed for 12 min.
in full-strength D-19, use sensitivity 15. If a different value is shown
on CRT page 1, type &quot;sens 15&quot;. 
<LI>In setting up the illumination conditions, note that at 200 kV, the condenser
must be set by turning<B> ANTICLOCKWISE</B> from crossover. At 400kV, the condenser is set <B>CLOCKWISE</B> from crossover. This avoids vignetting by the objective aperture and allows
maximum image shift. All three setup positions must have the condenser adjusted
in the same direction from crossover. 
<LI>Three setup positions are provided: SEARCH, PHOTO, and FOCUS. After the
initial setup is completed, the position is switched from SEARCH to FOCUS
when the &quot;return&quot; key is pressed, and only goes to PHOTO when the photo
button is pressed. 
<LI>For initial setup, and for modification of the setup during a run, the setup
position can be set directly by typing P,F, or S. 
<LI>Any desired magnifcation, image shift, and illumination conditions can be
set independently for each of the three setup positions, however we use
the the following conditions: 
</OL>
<MENU>
<LI>PHOTO--desired magnification, with illumination just filling the film area. 
<LI>SEARCH--5000X (minimum magnification) with low-intensity illumination of
the area to be photographed; image viewed on the TV-rate camera. 
<LI>FOCUS--same magnification as PHOTO, but a small area adjacent to the photographed
area is seen on the TV monitor. 
</MENU>
<H3><A NAME="Setup">Setup</A> procedure</H3>
<OL>
<LI>Type MDP. The PHOTO position will be selected at first. 
<LI>Set the magnification to 5000X and put a feature in the middle of the viewing
screen. Adjust the illunination conditions and the position of the objective
aperture. Make sure the image shifts are set to zero (both lights above
the knobs should be on). 
<LI>Select SEARCH and FOCUS positions, and duplicate the same conditions in
all three positions. (This procedure is advised so all positions will have
the same starting point.) 
<LI>Select SEARCH. The magnification should still be 5000X, and the feature
should still be in the center of the screen. Move the feature about 2cm
to the left with the stage translations, then move it back to the center
with the image shifts. (This procedure is necessary to accomodate both the
video and the photo &quot;detector positions&quot; within the range of electronic
image shift). 
<LI>Select PHOTO and FOCUS, and center the feature with the image shifts in
both cases. 
<LI>Select SEARCH. Move the feature to the video position (about 3cm to the
left of the screen center) using the image shifts, and recenter the illumination.
Set the illuminated area to about 1.5cm diameter, and set the spot size
to as small as possible (hopefully 7) which gives a useable TV image. Lift
the screen to see the TV image, and refine the centering of the feature
and illumination on the TV monitor. 
<LI>**Without moving the translators, move feature to the center using image
shift in photo and focus mode. Go back to search. Then put the feature on
the left corner using image shift, and follow with beam shift and aperture
if necessary. Adjust brightness for camera, increasing spot size to 7. 
<LI>Select PHOTO. 
<LI>Keeping the feature in the center with the image shifts (NOT the stage translations),
increase the magnification as desired. 
<LI>Recenter the illumination and set the size of the illuminated area to just
fill the film area. 
<LI>Check the voltage center with the binoculars using the HT wobbler. Adjust
using the beam tilt controls, if necessary, then readjust the illumination. 
<LI>Check the centering of the objective aperture. 
<LI>Set the exposure by adjusting the spotsize and bias controls (but don't
exceed the permissible beam current value!!). Check the exposure with the
small focussing screen to give a 1-2 second exposure. 
<LI>Set the exposure mode to manual and select the closest available exposure
time. NOTE: Make the exposure time a bit longer than required for the untilted
image so that it will be adequate once the specimen is tilted to 60 degrees
during tomography. 
<LI>Select SEARCH, lift the screen, and check to see that the feature which
was at the center in PHOTO is in the center of the TV monitor. If not, adjust
the image shifts. 
<LI>Select FOCUS. Set the magnification to the same used in PHOTO, and keep
the feature at the center of the screen. 
<LI>Move the feature about 3cm to the right with the image shifts. 
<LI>Set the illumination to about 1.5cm diameter, and select spot size to 6
or 7 . 
<LI>Move the illuminated area to the TV position (about 3cm to the left of center)
with the illumination shifts. 
<LI>Lift the screen and check centering of the illumination to fill the TV screen. 
<LI>Check all positions again and touch-up any position which might have changed
slightly. 
</OL>
<H3><A NAME="Taking">Taking</A> single low-dose images</H3>
<OL>
<LI>Make sure the screen is up. 
<LI>Select SEARCH and find an object to photograph. 
<LI>Press return to get the FOCUS position. 
<LI>Focus the image and press the photo button to take the picture. 
<LI>NOTE: You will see a faint flash on the TV screen when the picture is being
taken. If you see no flash, you will not have an exposed negative. 
<LI>The SEARCH position will be automatically selected after photography, but
you must raise the screen by pushing the button. 
<LI>Look for the next object. 
<LI>If moving to another part of the grid, the setups may have to be &quot;touched
up&quot;. 
<LI>When finished, press the &quot;ESC&quot; key to stop MDP. 
<LI>NOTES 
</OL>
<UL>
<LI>No commands other than MDP commands can be issued to the microscope computer
while MDP is engaged. 
<LI>The setup is saved, so MDP can be restarted with the same setup after, for
example, a film change (which may require a command to set the film stock
number), or if the microscope has a problem and has to be restarted in some
way. 
</UL>
<H3>Collecting a tilt <A NAME="series">series</A></H3>
<OL>
<LI>Select SEARCH and locate the object to be recorded. 
<LI>Tilt to -60 degrees while following the object. 
<LI>At 60 degrees, refocus and check the PHOTO and FOCUS positions. The change
of focus will likely require readjustment of the size position of the illuminated
area. NOTE: It will occasionally be necessary to check the PHOTO area and
reset the illumination during the tilt series, if you notice that the focus
is changing rapidly and by a large amount (i.e. more than 10 microns). 
<LI>For cryo-tomography: set the TV sto manual so the thickness of the ice can
be judged. Find a good area of ice thickness, with thicker ice (or carbon)
to the left for focussing. 
<LI>Don't forget to look for the flash on TV screen during exposure

<H3>Low-dose and tomographic series recording on the HVEM</H3>
<P>Under construction!</P>
<P>The HVEM does not have off-axis focus or tracking, however the TV-rate CCD
camera on the HVEM has more sensitivity and resolution than the IVEM's TV-rate
camera. Thus, low-dose recording can be done with on-axis focussing and
tracking, together with recording on sensitive x-ray mammography film. Great
care must be taken in use of the sensitive TV-rate camera to avoid damage
to the camera or scintillator. Procedures will be written for this and posted
here.</P>
