1. cd to /net/ithaca/usr9/ivem
2. To start automatic sending of images, type:
   perl autosend.perl
3. Each time a new image is detected in:

   it will be converted to JPG and sent to:
   euclid:  /usr1/WWW/ivem/operate/images
   From there, it can be accessed from:
   http://www.wadsworth.org/ivem/operate/index.html
