<p><a name="STRUCTURE"></a> <b><u>ZI file structure</u></b></p>

<p>ZI files are BIG. A typical scanned micrograph is 11,000 x
14,000 8-bit pixels - about 150 Mb (Megabytes). When it's converted
to a 4-byte spider file, it will occupy 600 Mb of disk space.</p>

<p>ZI scans are tif files. However, data is arranged in a tiled
format which may not be readable by some image viewers. They also
have some proprietary header values set aside, e.g., for
transmissivity values).</p>

<p>ZI files contain a set of increasingly smaller overviews: each
successive overview averages 4 pixels into 1 pixel, so the size of
the overviews decreases by powers of 2. Here is a typical set of
overviews:</p>

<p>Note:<br>
Overview 1 corresponds to the full size image.<br>
Overview 2 roughly corresponds to the size of HiScan files.<br>
Smaller overviews have better SNR due to averaging of pixels.<br>
Overview numbers may not correspond to numbers in the Photoscan
software.<br>
</p>

<p><a name="CONVERT"></a> <b><u>Converting ZI files to SPIDER
format</u></b></p>

<p>Until a SPIDER operation such as CP FROM ZI is available, there
is a utility on the Unix systems and the ZI PC called
<i>zi2spi</i>. It takes a ZI scanned file and an overview number as
input, and converts that overview to a SPIDER file. Pixel values
are converted to their transmissivity values. It expects as input
the original ZI scanned file with a full set of ovrviews, not an
extracted overview or the raw bytes. Usage:</p>

<pre>
zi2spi inputfile outputfile overview#
</pre>

For example: 

<pre>
zi2spi zi001.tif mic001.spi 2
</pre>

will take overview #2 in zi001.tif and convert it to the SPIDER
file mic001.spi. It can also be called from a procedure file using VM: 

<pre>
VM
zi2spi zi{***x11}.tif mic{***x11}.spi 3
</pre>

Note that the extensions of both the ZI and SPIDER files must be
indicated in a 'VM' operation. <i>zi2spi</i> is located in
/usr/local/spider/bin on Unix machines, and in C:\Program
Files\ZI\Common Files on the ZI PC. There is also a procedure file,
convert.bat, for converting many files at once (see below). 

<p><a name="BATCH"></a> <b><u>Batch files</u></b></p>

<p>Because of the size of ZI scans, it may be preferable to do some
processing on the ZI PC, and then move the smaller results files to
a Unix machine. Some procedure files from the Single Particle
Reconstruction web page have been adapted to permit this. Network
connectivity via Solstice is available on the ZI PC.</p>

<p>As an alternative to the procedures described below, you can
just move the scans to sylt, convert the full-size images to SPIDER
format, and just treat them as regular project files.</p>

<p>The procedure files on the ZI PC are located in C:\Program
Files\SPIDER\docs\recon\zi_progs<br>
Or you can set the URL of a browser to C:\Program
Files\SPIDER\docs\recon\mr.html to view the single Particle
Reconstruction web page. It contains pointers to the zi procedure
files.</p>

<p><a name="POWER"></a> <b><u>Power Spectra</u></b></p>

<p><u>On the ZI PC</u><br>
Use the procedure file powerzi.bat (and its procedures powerzi_p1,
powerzi_p2) to convert scans to spider files, and generate images
of power spectra (pw_avg*** files) as well as document files of
their rotational averages (roo*** files).</p>

<p>It uses overview 2 (2x smaller).</p>

<p>In the parameter file (created with makeparams.bat):<br>
- set the file type to 3 (for ZI)<br>
- set the pixelsize to 2.82 (for overview 2 - see table above).<br>
- If the window size &amp; actual size (of the particle) are set to
zero, the procedure file will compute appropriate values based on the
pixelsize. If you want the program to use specific window sizes,
set these values in the parameter doc file.</p>

<p><u>On a Unix machine</u><br>
Currently, we cannot view SPIDER files or run Web on that PC.
Transfer the pw_avg*** and roo*** files to a Unix machine to look
at the rings and calculate defocus in Web.</p>

<p>Gnuplot is on the PC, so you can look at the rotationaly
averaged files. Note, the transmissivity values are quite small
compared to the HiScan, so you will have to add an extra zero to
the plotpower files, eg.,</p>

<pre>
set yrange [0:0.00005]
</pre>

<p><a name="PICK"></a> <b><u>Particle Picking</u></b></p>

<p>You can run pick.bat on the PC, but since Web is not available,
you cannot do the manual particle selection there.</p>

<p>For now, it is recommended to extract small overviews from the
scans, transfer them to a unix machine, do the particle selection
on those files, and then send the coordinates back to the ZI PC to
extract particles from the full-sized images.</p>

<p><u>On the ZI PC</u><br>
1) Extract an overview and convert it to spider: use convert.bat
with the overview number set to 3 (it's 4x smaller, but you can
change this to 2 (2x smaller) if you want).</p>

<p>2) Move the spider micrograph files to a Unix machine.</p>

<p><u>On a Unix machine</u><br>
3) Set parameters in the params file accordingly:<br>
- set the file type to 0 (for SPIDER files)<br>
 - set the pixelsize to 5.64 (for overview 3 - see table
above).<br>
- set the window size &amp; actual size each to zero. The procedure
file pick.bat will compute appropriate values based on the
pixelsize.<br>
</p>

<p>4) Run SPIDER with the procedure files from <a href=
"/net/bali/usr1/spider/docs/techs/recon/mr.html">Single Particle
Reconstruction web page</a>.<br>
 pick.bat<br>
 pnums.bat<br>
 Do the manual particle selection in Web.<br>
 renumber.bat<br>
. newcoords.bat, which generates new coordinates to extract
windowed particles from the full-sized image.<br>
