   <title> RNA protein separation </title>
</head>

<body>

<h2 align="center">RNA protein separation</h2>

<p>
This directory contains SPIDER procedure files and sample data for the 
separation of a cryo-EM map into nucleic acid and protein densities.
</p>

<p> Please note that for the method to work the input volume has to be
of fairly high resolution.  Between 10 and 15 A should be ok.  (If you
have a very high resolution (<8 A) you usually can seperate the
components just by density thresholding without need for this method.)
It is also important that the amplitudes at high frequencies are
enhanced to counteract the effect of the envelope function (e.g. by
adjusting the power spectrum of the volume to a X-ray scattering curve
in solution).</p>

<p />
This work is described in <b>A method for differentiating proteins from nucleic 
acids in intermediate-resolution density maps: cryo-electron microscopy defines 
the quaternary structure of the Escherichia coli 70S ribosome</b> 
Christian M.T. Spahn, Pawel A. Penczek, Ardean Leith, and Joachim Frank. 
<i>Structure</i>Volume 8, Issue 9, Pages 905-1014 (1 September 2000).

<h3>Notes </h3>

<hr />


<p>A 40S ribosome volume was interpolated down to 102x102x102 voxels from
which histograms and separation were done. Interpolated data is in
<a href="40s.dat">40s.dat</a>.</p>
