<h3>What is the contrast transfer function?</h3>
<p>
The image formation in bright field electron microscopy 
can be described 
by the action of the contrast transfer function (CTF) H(<b>k</b>).  
Accordingly, the relationship between the object o(<b>r</b>) and the 
image contrast i(<b>r</b>) can be written as 
i(<b>r</b>) = o(<b>r</b>)* h(<b>r</b>), where * stands for the 
convolution 
operation, and h(<b>r</b>) is the point spread function, which is the 
Fourier transform of H(<b>k</b>).  Thus, following the convolution 
theorem, I(<b>k</b>) = O(<b>k</b>)H(<b>k</b>).
<p>
The shape of the CTF, H(<b>k</b>), depends on several parameters (for 
details, see <a href="#ref">Frank, 2006</a>): 
<p>
<i>defocus</i> [A] - which describes the deviation in the focus of
 the objective lens from the "Gaussian focus."
<br>
<i>spherical aberration coefficient</i>  [mm] - which describes the 
(third order) spherical aberration of the wave front in the objective lens.
<br>
<i>source size</i> [1/A] - which describes the illumination divergence, 
expressed as a size in the back focal plane (hence a quantity in reciprocal space).
<br>
<i>defocus spread</i> - which describes the spread of defocus due to 
the spread of electron energies or to the fluctuation of lens current.
<p>
The only parameter being varied in the experiment is the defocus. 
Depending on the defocus setting, different features of the object 
appear enhanced or suppressed in the image.  This is because the 
CTF oscillates between -1 (negative contrast transfer) and +1 
(positive contrast transfer) as we go from low to high spatial 
frequencies.  The exact locations of the zero crossings (where 
no contrast is transferred, and information is lost) depends on 
the defocus.

<h3>CTF correction</h3>
<p></p>
In CTF correction, we attempt to retrieve the undistorted object from the image.
This attempt is compromised by the presence of noise; i.e., recovery of 
the object is never ideal.
Since the CTF always has zero crossings, part of the information about the object is lost.
This is why we make use of <i>several images obtained at different defocus settings</i>,
 hoping that the resulting CTFs H<sub>n</sub>(<b>k</b>) jointly 
(after appropriate weighting) cover the whole Fourier space without gap.
<p>
The <i>Wiener filter</i> is the least square solution to the problem 
of signal recovery in the presence 
of noise.  Let's assume we have N images i<sub>n</sub> (<b>r</b>)  
(with Fourier transforms I<sub>n</sub>(<b>k</b>)) whose CTFs are H<sub>n</sub>(<b>k</b>). 
 In that case, the best estimation of the object transform O(<b>k</b>) is

where

and SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio, defined as the ratio of signal to noise variances.

<h3>Example of CTF correction</h3>
<p></p>
In the SPIDER procedure file, <a href="ctfexample.spi">ctfexample.spi</a>, 
we first simulate the action of the electron microscope, by applying a CTF 
to an "object", which is the projection of the 3D density map of the ribosome, 
and adding noise to the result, and then use the 2D Wiener filtering operation 
described above to retrieve the original.  The gallery of images describes 
the progress of these operations. Note that the choice SNR=100 makes the 
Wiener filter quite aggressive, and this benefits the recovery of low 
spatial frequencies responsible for defining the particle's boundary 
and overall shape.

<h3>CTF parameters in SPIDER and single particle reconstruction</h3>
<p></p>
Various CTF parameters are used in SPIDER's 
<a href="../../../docs/operations_doc.html#T">TF operations</a>. 

These parameters, along with some others, are listed in a 
<a href="../../../docs/techs/recon/params.html">parameter document file</a>. 
(See also the <a href="../../../docs/glossary.html">glossary</a> for definitions.)
<p></p>
In <a href="../../../docs/techs/recon/mr.html">single particle reconstruction</a>,
<ul>
<li> several <a href="../../../docs/techs/recon/mr.html#CTF">procedure files</a>: 
1)  compute the power spectra of the micrographs, 2) estimate defocus, and 
3) assign micrographs to defocus groups.
</li>
<li> CTF parameters are estimated with the the SPIDER operation 
<a href="../../../docs/man/tfed.html">TF ED</a>.
</li>
<li> CTF correction is applied during 
<a href="../../../docs/techs/recon/mr.html#3D">3D reconstruction</a>, 
via the <a href="../../../docs/man/tfcts.html">TF CTS</a> operation.
</li>
<li> In this approach, 3-dimensional CTF correction is carried out for 
each defocus group, creating a volume for each defocus group. These 
volumes are combined to form a single, CTF-corrected volume. For 
details, see <a href="#ref">Penczek et al.,1997</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>CTF graphical tools</h3>
<p></p>
A number of graphical tools are included with the 
<a href="../../../../spire/doc/index.html">SPIRE</a> distribution:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../../../../spire/doc/guitools/ctfdemo.html">ctfdemo.py</a> : 
a graphical interface that lets you experiment with the various 
CTF parameters used in SPIDER.</li>

<li>
<a href="../../../../spire/doc/guitools/ctfmatch/ctfmatch.html">ctfmatch.py</a> :
 a tool for analyzing the output from SPIDER's TF ED operation.</li>

<li>
<a href="../../../../spire/doc/guitools/ctfgroup.html">ctfgroup.py</a> : 
graphically assign micrographs to defocus groups.</li>

</ul>
