<h3>What is the contrast transfer function?</h3>

<p>
  The image formation in bright field electron microscopy 
  can be described by the action of the contrast transfer function (CTF) H(<b>k</b>).  
  Accordingly, the relationship between the object o(<b>r</b>) and the 
  image contrast i(<b>r</b>) can be written as 
  i(<b>r</b>) = o(<b>r</b>)* h(<b>r</b>), where * stands for the 
  convolution operation, and h(<b>r</b>) is the point spread function, which is the 
  Fourier transform of H(<b>k</b>).  Thus, following the convolution 
  theorem, I(<b>k</b>) = O(<b>k</b>)H(<b>k</b>).
</p>
<p>
  The shape of the CTF, H(<b>k</b>), depends on several parameters (for 
  details, see <a href="#ref">Frank, 2006</a>): 
</p>

<p>
  <i>defocus</i> [A] - which describes the deviation in the focus of
  the objective lens from the "Gaussian focus."                                      <br />
  <i>spherical aberration coefficient</i>  [mm] - which describes the 
  (third order) spherical aberration of the wave front in the objective lens.        <br />
  <i>source size</i> [1/A] - which describes the illumination divergence, 
  expressed as a size in the back focal plane (hence a quantity in reciprocal space).<br />
  <i>defocus spread</i> - which describes the spread of defocus due to 
  the spread of electron energies or to the fluctuation of lens current.
</p>

<p>
  The only parameter being varied in the experiment is the defocus. 
  Depending on the defocus setting, different features of the object 
  appear enhanced or suppressed in the image.  This is because the 
  CTF oscillates between -1 (negative contrast transfer) and +1 
  (positive contrast transfer) as we go from low to high spatial 
  frequencies.  The exact locations of the zero crossings (where 
  no contrast is transferred, and information is lost) depends on 
  the defocus.

<h3>CTF correction</h3>

</p>

<p>
  In CTF correction, we attempt to retrieve the undistorted object from the image.
  This attempt is compromised by the presence of noise; i.e., recovery of 
  the object is never ideal.
  Since the CTF always has zero crossings, part of the information about the object is lost.
  This is why we make use of <i>several images obtained at different defocus settings</i>,
  hoping that the resulting CTFs H<sub>n</sub>(<b>k</b>) jointly 
  (after appropriate weighting) cover the whole Fourier space without gap.
</p>

<p>
  The <i>Wiener filter</i> is the least square solution to the problem 
  of signal recovery in the presence 
  of noise.  Let's assume we have N images i<sub>n</sub> (<b>r</b>)  
  (with Fourier transforms I<sub>n</sub>(<b>k</b>)) whose CTFs are H<sub>n</sub>(<b>k</b>). 
  In that case, the best estimation of the object transform O(<b>k</b>) is

  <center><img src="Eq-1.gif"></center>
  where
  <center><img src="Eq-2.gif"></center>

  and SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio, defined as the ratio of signal to noise variances.

<h3>Example of CTF correction</h3>
</p>

<p>
  In the SPIDER procedure file, <a href="ctfexample.spi">ctfexample.spi</a>, 
  we first simulate the action of the electron microscope, by applying a CTF 
  to an "object", which is the projection of the 3D density map of the ribosome, 
  and adding noise to the result, and then use the 2D Wiener filtering operation 
  described above to retrieve the original.  The gallery of images describes 
  the progress of these operations. Note that the choice SNR=100 makes the 
  Wiener filter quite aggressive, and this benefits the recovery of low 
  spatial frequencies responsible for defining the particle's boundary 
  and overall shape.

<h3>CTF parameters in SPIDER and single particle reconstruction</h3>
</p>

<p>
  Various CTF parameters are used in SPIDER's 
  <a href="../../../docs/ctfops.html">'TF' operations</a>. 

  See the <a href="../../../docs/glossary.html">glossary</a> for definitions.

  These parameters, along with some others, are listed in a 
  <a href="../../../docs/techs/recon/params.html">parameter document file</a>. 
</p>

 <p>
 In <a href="../../../docs/techs/recon1/mr1.html">
        single particle reconstruction using projection matching without defocus groups</a> <br />   or
 in <a href="../../../docs/techs/recon/mr.html">
        single particle reconstruction using projection matching with defocus groups</a>    <br />

 CTF estimation is done on the micrographs or windowed particles using procedures to.
 <ol>
   <li>Compute the power spectra of the micrographs </li> 
   <li>Estimate defocus using <a href="../../../docs/man/ctfed.html">'CTF FIND'</a> </li>
 </ol>
 
 <p>
 In <a href="../../../docs/techs/recon1/mr1.html">
    single particle reconstruction without defocus groups</a> <br />
 <ul>
  <li>CTF correction is applied to the windowed particle images before
       <a href="../../../docs/techs/recon1/mr1.html#3D">3D reconstruction</a>, 
       using the 
       <a href="../../../docs/man/tfcts.html">'TF CTS'</a> operation.               </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
 In <a href="../../../docs/techs/recon/mr.html">
       single particle reconstruction with defocus groups</a>:
 <ul>
   <li>CTF correction can applied during 
     <a href="../../../docs/techs/recon/mr.html#3D">3D reconstruction</a>, 
     using the 
     <a href="../../../docs/man/tfcts.html">'TF CTS'</a> operation.
   </li>

   <li>In this approach, 3-dimensional CTF correction is carried out for 
       each defocus group, creating a volume for each defocus group. These 
       volumes are combined to form a single, CTF-corrected volume. For 
       details, see <a href="#ref">Penczek et al.,1997</a>.
