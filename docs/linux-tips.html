Linux directories


Directory

Use to store this kind of files

/bin

All your essential program (executable files)

/sbin

All super user executable (binaries) files

/home

Your sweet home. 

/etc

Configuration file of your Linux system are here. 

/lost+found

When your system crashes, this is the place where you will get your files. 

/var

Mostly the file(s) stored in this directory changes their size i.e. variable data files. 
Data files including spool 
directories and files, administrative and logging data, and transient and temporary files etc.

/usr

Central location for all your application program, x-windows, man pages, documents etc are here. 
Programs 
meant to be used and shared by all of the users on the system. Some of the important 
sub-directories are as 
follows:
bin-sub-directory contains executablessbin-sub-directory contains files for 
system administration i.e. binariesinclude-sub-contains C header filesshare-sub-contains 
contains files that aren't architecture-specific like documents, wallpaper etc.
X11R6-sub-contains X Window System

/lib

All shared library files are stored here. This libraries are needed to execute the 
executable files (binary) files in 
/bin or /sbin.

/tmp

Temporary file location

/dev

Special Device files are stored here. For e.g. Keyboard, mouse, console, hard-disk, cdrom etc device files are here.

/mnt

Floppy disk, CD-Rom disk, Other MS-DOS/Windows partition mounted in this location (mount points) i.e. 
temporarily mounted file systems are here.

/boot

Linux Kernel directory

/opt

Use to store large software applications like star office.

/proc

This directory contains special files which interact with kernel. 




Secure connections and transfers


..Connections:
..ssh156.111.6.184ssh.X magali@156.111.6.184



..transfers:
..sftpmagali@156.111.6.184, thenput/get
..scp(-r) files machine:pathscp*.pam 156.111.6.184:/usr10/magali



..Example: connect and transfer files on the master node of the cluster
..Connect with ssh-X magali@156.111.6.1977
..Check the disk space:
/home/magali> df-h ./
FilesystemSize Used Avail Use% Mounted on/dev/sdc1 2.2T 1.3T 985G 56% /master.raid
..Check the space usage of your files:
magali/Master_cluster> du -hsctftilt262M ctftilt
..Transfer files from the cluster to your computer: 
scp.r Xlk156.111.6.46:/space
..Note: to log on a node from the master node:
% rshnode42







Miscellaneous


..whoami---returns your username. Sounds useless, but isn't. You may need to find 
out who it is who forgot to log out somewhere
..date ---shows the current date and time. 
..Archiving: tar
..tar .cvfmyarchive.tar *.pam
..tar .cvzfmyarchive.tar.gz*.pam
..tar .xvfmyarchive.tar
..tar .xvzfmyarchive.tar.gz



..File Compression:
..gzipfilename ---Produces filename.gz
..gunzipfilename ---uncompressesfiles compressed by gzip. 
..compress/uncompress: .Z format
..zip/unzip: .zip format



..Redirection: >and |
cat file1.txt file2.txt > file3.txtps.ef| more




What is a C shell script ?


..Normally shells are interactive. It means shell accept command from 
you (via keyboard) and execute them. But if you use the commands 
one by one, you can store this sequence of commands in a text file 
and tell the shell to execute this text file instead of entering the 
commands.
..In addition, most UNIX shells have the capability of command flow 
logic ( goto, if/then/else/endifetc.), retrieving the command line 
parameters, defining and using (shell) variables etc. 
..Useful to create our own commands, save lots of time, automate 
some tasks 




Getting started with Shell Programming


..You need your favorite text editor: nedit, emacs, vi, ...
..After writing shell script set execute permission for your script as 
  follows chmod permissions your-script-name$ chmod+x your-script-name$ chmod755 your-script-name
..Execute your script:
./your-script-nameIn the last syntax ./ means current directory
..Example$ vi first.csh#! /bin/csh# Comment: My first shell scriptclearecho "Knowledge is Power"
..After saving the above script, change the rights and launch it: 
./first.csh
..Tip: try to give file extension such as .cshor .sh, which can be easily 
identified by you as shell script.
..Note, the examples will be specific of the csh. These might not work with 
bash.




Variables in Shell


..In Linux (Shell), there are two types of variable:
..System variables -Created and maintained by Linux itself. 
..User defined variables -Created and maintained by user. 
..Examples of system variables:
..SHELL
..PATH
..OSTYPE



..Your start file (.cshrc) is a shell script, automatically sourced each 
time you open a terminal window. If you make a modification to 
your .cshrc, to see the effects, either you must source it, either 
open a new terminal.
..If you want to know the value of a variable:


$ echo $USERNAME$ echo $HOME



How to define User defined variables (UDV)

..To define UDV use following syntax (csh& tcsh):

set variable = value, ex:
set start = 1set coos = .../coords/sndc.

..Variables are case-sensitive, just like filenames in Linux
..Do not use ?,* etc.to name your variable names (they are 
.wildcards.)
..To print or access UDV use following syntax :
..$variablenameis the content of variablename
..echo $variablenameto print the content of variablename


..Shell Arithmetic: exprop1 math-operator op2, ex:
..% expr1 + 34
..% set sum = `expr1 + 3`
% echo $sum4




Wild cards * ? [.]


*

Matches any string or group of characters.

$ ls*

$ lsa*

$ ls*.c 

$ lsut*.c

?

Matches any single character.

$ lsfo?

[.]

[..-..]

Matches any one of the enclosed characters

A pair of characters separated by a minus sign 
denotes a range.

$ ls[abc]*




Redirection of Standard output/input i.e. Input -Output redirection


..Mostly all command gives output on screen or take input from 
keyboard, but it's possible to send output to file or to read input 
from file.
..% lscommand gives output to screen; to send output to file of lscommand give command
..% ls> filename --It means put output of lscommand to filename.



..There are 4 main redirection symbols >, >>, <, <<
..(1) > Redirector Symbol 
..(2) >> Redirector Symbol (append to the end)
..(3) < Redirector Symbol: To take input to Linux-command from file 
instead of key-board. For e.g. To take input for cat command give% cat < myfiles
..(4)<< special form of redirection is used in shell scripts. Ex:
ctftilt.exe << eof. (options)
eofthe input is taken from the current file (usually the shell script file) until 
the string following the "<<" is found.




Pipes


..A pipe is a way to connect the output of one program to the input of 
another program without any temporary file.
..Syntax:
command1 | command2
..Examples:
..ls| more
..ps.ef| grepspider




Control structures (if)


..The C shell has control structures similar to the C programming language. 
These are foreach, if, switch and while. These are usually used in shell scripts
..if (condition) simple command
..if (condition)
thencommands.
fi
..if (condition)
thencommands.
elsecommands.
fi
..You can have nested if-else-fi




Loops


..while:


while (expr)
command(s) 
end

..foreach:
foreachvar(wordlist) 
command(s) 
end
..label:
label.
gotolabel
