Overview

The SPIDER Python Library was developed to provide functions for handling SPIDER files in your Python programs. In particular, your scripts can read or write Spider document files in a single line. Data columns from doc files can be treated as arrays. The Python Imaging Library (a separate library available from http://effbot.org/downloads/#imaging) provides general image processing operations for SPIDER images, and lets you display them in Tkinter. Numerical array operations may also be applied to SPIDER images and volumes via the Numpy Library (sourceforge.net/project/numpy).

Installation

Download the file SpiderPythonLibrary-1.2.tar.gz from http://www.wadsworth.org/spider_doc/spider/download

       gunzip SpiderPythonLibrary-1.2.tar.gz
       tar xvf SpiderPythonLibrary-1.2.tar
       cd SpiderPythonLibrary-1.2
Run setup.py install (or just copy the Spider/ directory to your Python site-packages directory.) 

Documentation

See the documentation at http://www.wadsworth.org/spider_doc/spider/docs/python/spipylib/index.html
